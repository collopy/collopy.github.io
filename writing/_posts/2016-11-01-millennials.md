The internet was abuzz this August with speculation about why Millennials have less sex than our elders did at our age. Perhaps economic precarity makes dating difficult, particularly for those living with their parents. Mediating our relationships through the internet could reduce physical contact. Or maybe ubiquitous pornography is replacing partnered sex, antidepressants are depressing libidos, higher standards of consent reduce the incidence of “pressured sex,” asexual people are more comfortable in their identities, or Millennials are simply too busy for sexual relationships.
