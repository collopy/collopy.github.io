Five friends and I get together once a week to play role-playing games. A role-playing game is a game in which the players control characters, usually in a fantasy or science fiction setting. One player, called the gamemaster, controls all of the external effects on the players’ characters, including other characters, monsters, animals, and even the weather. The other players each control one or more player characters who, in almost all role-playing games, go through various adventures.
