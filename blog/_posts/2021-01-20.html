People often argue that removing monuments or renaming buildings will cause us to forget. What if the opposite is true, and monuments and building names are obstacles to nuanced historical understanding? What if every one is a sacrifice of our ability to learn from our history?

I’m posing this as a hypothetical, but I think it’s pretty clearly the case. We most understand those who we know about but don’t celebrate.

“It is one of the ways the Western world has learned or thinks it has learned to outwit history, to outwit time—to make a life and death irrelevant, to make that passion irrelevant, to make it unusable for you and for our children.” —James Baldwin on Atlanta’s MLK memorial, 1980

(From the 1982 documentary <cite>I Heard It Through the Grapevine</cite>, quoted and discussed in Eddie S. Glaude Jr.’s <cite>Begin Again</cite>, pages 158–159.)

Of course fascists want to keep Confederate monuments because they impede real understanding. But also, if those who love democracy and justice want to learn from our predecessors, maybe we shouldn’t put them up on pedestals.

Monuments are artificial reliquaries for secular saints. There are good reasons why hagiography is a term of abuse among historians.
