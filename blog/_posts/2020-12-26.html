I spend more time listening to podcasts than experiencing any other medium. Here’s what I’ve been listening to this year, in no particular order.

LA Podcast is a witty, astute weekly discussion of LA politics. It’s engaged with the city’s transformational social movements as well as with our elected officials’ approaches to transit, homelessness, and police brutality—and their bribery scandals. This year, the hosts have started two more shows: Thirty Mile Zone revisits movies set in LA with particular attention to their geography and how they represent specific places. The Ten interviews local figures about their experiences of the city in ten questions. And LA Podcast’s Zoom-based holiday party was a delight, showing the city’s activist and creative energy in a December I’m otherwise finding very dark and sad.

RIP Corp is a new show about business failures from the great Ingrid Burrington. So far: Blockbuster and Enron’s 2000 internet video-on-demand effort, and the fall and rise of <cite>It’s a Wonderful Life</cite>.

Accidental Tech Podcast is the one podcast I listen to in the “ludicrously long, all dudes talking about computers” genre. It’s comfort food for me, but also a big part of how I understand the—mostly Apple—machines I spend a lot of my time thinking with.

On the same topic, we’re one episode from the end of Six Colors’ 20 Macs for 2020, an episode each on the most interesting Mac models of the past 36 years. It’s been a really well-produced review of the history of the platform and the design space of personal computing.

Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Podcast is the one podcast I listen to the “hanging out with hilarious brothers” genre. It’s had 31 occasional episodes in eight years (and four tweets?), but each is worth the wait.

Hari Kondabolu’s more regularly scheduled podcast is Politically ReActive, with W. Kamau Bell. It’s mostly interviews with left-liberal politicians, organizers, and fellow performers. The recent Daveed Diggs episode was especially wonderful for its “advanced-level Oakland shit.”

I’ve listened to all of Dan Savage’s Savage Lovecast over 14 years, so part of it now is guessing Dan’s advice & whether I’ll agree. About a month ago, I meant to call in to disagree with his guest’s advice for a Jewish woman observing niddah, but I didn’t actually do it.…

In that call, I would have recommended The Joy of Text, which features progressive Orthodox discussions of sex and sexuality. For me, outside but sometimes near that world, it’s a way to think Jewishly with some generous and observant (in both senses) hosts.

The other advice podcast I listen to is Daniel Lavery’s Dear Prudence. This year has seen more questions about trans experiences from both trans and cis people, so while the show is, like life, “a rich tapestry,” it has become more of a space for thinking about gender for me.

Speaking of which, I’ve only listened to a few episodes of Tuck Woodstock’s Gender Reveal, but <a href="https://gender.libsyn.com/episode-71-daniel-m-lavery">their interview with Daniel Lavery</a> about transition and the roles of trans memoir was fantastic.

It’s appearing on plenty of more prominent lists, but, after a massive movement to end white supremacy, You’re Wrong About has been my second favorite thing about this year. I listened to 90 episodes in a couple months over the summer. The effort to actually understand recent history and not just experience it flowing past us or look back with nostalgia, and doing that with wit and humor and a search for justice, is really enjoyable and edifying.

Both hosts started new podcasts this year. I haven’t listened to all of Why Are Dads because I feel like I have to have seen the movies, but Maintenance Phase is a great You’re Wrong About for health and nutrition.

One theme of this emerging podcast empire is that both public understanding and expert knowledge are often bullshit which collapses under scrutiny. Most debunking, even and especially under the banner of “skepticism,” props up scientific expertise; You’re Wrong About and Maintenance Phase are genuinely skeptical, honoring the hard work of research but not the mere labeling of something as science. The Maintenance Phase episode on the President’s Physical Fitness Test and the (latest!) You’re Wrong About episode on the Stanford Prison Experiment are good examples of this genuine skepticism, as are any episodes involving police, like the DC Snipers ones.

Another key theme, which is right on the surface, is feminism, and particularly at attention to and affection for women who have been judged much more harshly in the public imagination than the men around them who often did more harm.

One thing I’m saying here, then, is that these are really great public humanities projects and those of us doing that kind of work should learn from them.

The War on Cars is partly about bike and other mobility advocacy, and partly about how dangerous and destructive cars actually are—one of those key truths at the center of our society which we pretend isn’t in order to get through our days.

They’ve often focused this year on the car as a political weapon, but they also have room for other truths, usually also about cars; <a href="https://thewaroncars.org/2020/05/08/driving-while-black-with-gretchen-sorin">their interview with historian Gretchen Sorin</a> about the car as a tool for Black liberation is particularly worth a listen.

Kristiania Clark’s The Uncertain Hour is about the contingent world in which public policy is made and remakes the world. The first seasons were on welfare, regulation, & the War on Drugs. This year’s was on work, quarantine, unemployment, housing, & homelessness in a pandemic. I think the first three seasons were stronger for being produced more deliberately rather than in a moment of crisis, and would recommend them first, particularly season 3, which traces the roles of government in drug policy from crack to opioids.

This weekend, I listened to Jamie Loftus’ Lolita Podcast. It’s great cultural history, exploring how Nabokov’s novel has been interpreted in adaptations to film, stage, and other media, & what these rather drastic deviations tell us about cultural acceptance of pedophilia. I listened to Loftus’ My Year in Mensa earlier this year, & it was funny & insightful about the white supremacy of many self-congratulatory “smart people.” Lolita Podcast is tighter, & it might just be my preference for history over ethnography, but I’m more excited about it.

I don’t find All In With Chris Hayes or any TV news appealing, but Chris Hayes’ interview podcast Why Is This Happening? is exactly the kind of deliberative, thoughtful conversation which daily media aren’t. Hayes takes both liberal and radical ideas seriously, and seems to enjoy that he has listeners across that spectrum. He’s both a tough and friendly interviewer, and occasionally brings in his knowledge of philosophy of science in unexpected ways.

It’s also on plenty of more prominent best podcast lists, but Code Switch is really great “view from somewhere” journalism, documenting what race and racism are now in America from distinct and clear perspectives.

One recent development is official TV show podcasts. Marc Evan Jackson hosts those for The Good Place (RIP) & Brooklyn 99. They’re mostly interviews with those who make the show, from writers & cast to locations & effects, & worth listening to if you’re watching the shows. I’ve also listened to official podcasts for Watchmen and Lovecraft Country this year, which have been more about close readings of individual episodes than making-of conversations. They’re blurring the line with fan podcasts, doing the same sort of thing but with greater access. On Lovecraft Country, I also listened to R & R in Lovecraft Country, which is also episode-by-episodes. It’s great at contextualizing the show in the weird and horror traditions, as well as in its historical settings.

Slow Burn has revisited Nixon & Clinton’s presidential scandals & the murders of Tupac Shakur & the Notorious B.I.G., with details that are little remembered or weren’t known then. This season, Josh Levin used David Duke’s career to explore the evolution of white supremacy. It’s timely recent history, in the era of alt-right figures embodying variants of David Duke’s image as KKK grand wizard turned besuited politician.

I also listened to the first few episodes of I Don’t Speak German, about the current fascist right. Their research and analysis is good, but the limited editing makes it a difficult listen, with a looseness about quoting fascist speech which often feels uncomfortable and unnecessary to me.

The investigative In the Dark covered the repeated Mississippi murder trials of Curtis Flowers in 2018 and 2019, bringing attention to the case which recently resulted in charges being dismissed. It consistently shows how policing and prosecution fails to produce justice. This year, they also covered “Coronavirus in the Delta,” Mississippi churches, prisons, hospitals, and college football during a pandemic.

Intercepted brings the better, antiauthoritarian side of The Intercept’s journalism to weekly podcast format. It’s mostly interviews, with commentary by Jeremy Scahill. Each episode sets the tone by starting with a gonzo sound collage sketch.

Pop Culture Happy Hour has gone from weekly to biweekly (in 2017) to daily (this year). For me these have been negative changes, making the discussions feel brisker and less connected to each other. But they remain often insightful collective reviews of film, television, music, and literature.

I’ve only listened to a couple episodes of Caltech Letters’ Biosphere so far. Its conversations among biology grad students offer a fly-on-the-wall experience which is great if you, like me, study biology from the outside and are curious how researchers talk to each other.

Like many organizations, Data &amp; Society releases lectures as a podcast. I’ve only listened to a few, but it’s a good way to hear from scholars about their new contributions in the area.
