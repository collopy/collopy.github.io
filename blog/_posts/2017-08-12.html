Possible definition of expertise: knowledge removed from its subject.

So expertise is the only kind of knowledge about things that don’t know—electrons, say—but about people, it competes with their experience.

Tacit knowledge might be intermediate here. I engage with electrons without a formal theory of them when I turn on lights or build circuits.
