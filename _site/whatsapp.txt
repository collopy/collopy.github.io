[7/9/23, 17:00:25] Peter Sachs Collopy: This is something Peter wrote this morning and wanted to share with you all:  

A life update, because it got weird. I fell off my bike commuting home Thursday and had a concussion and pretty extensive facial lacerations; presumably the head trauma would have been worse without a helmet. It seems like I probably wasn’t hit by a car. EMTs took me to the ER. I’m not sure what all they did because my memory only becomes consistent again at the end, but a plastic surgeon stitched up my face. Then they asked me to try standing, realized I couldn’t, and called in the MRI tech who was off. Turn out I have spinal damage, so Friday I went in for surgery and they fused two cervical vertebrae to make some more room for nerve healing. I mostly just can’t move my right fingers and toes much, and can only shuffle my right foot so far, not step it. So I have a lot of PT and OT ahead of me. Nurses have been amazing. I think I’m feeling a lot better emotionally that people expect due to a lot of engagement with disability studies the last few years; I want to walk and bike and type and handle print books again, and my prognosis is I probably will, but I also really believe that my life won’t be less if I can’t, just different and not what I expected and hoped. I know this is a long text. I look forward to talking but am also uncomfortably hoarse from intubation.

[7/10/23, 19:30:56] Peter Sachs Collopy: Quick update: Today I learned to walk with a walker! My right leg mobility and right finger mobility are really limited, but good enough to build new capabilities from. And I’m benefitting from good insurance, a great hospital, and checking the boxes of medical prioritization which mean I’ll probably be able to do a few weeks of in-patient rehab here before going home. That might start tomorrow, but it depends on the hospital and insurance.

Trotsky retorts that after the revolution, everyone will ride first class. So that’s this hospital. To quote and recommend the great Health Communism, let’s get all care for all people.

[7/12/23, 17:06:05] Allegra Giovine: I was also wondering!  any new musings today on your extremities or the state of health care in america?
[7/12/23, 17:17:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: So many, Allegra, but also exhaustion today. Lots of philosophical thoughts on permeability of the body, how committed capitalist heteropatriarchy is to denying it, and how important it is to adaptation and thus life. I’m thinking a lot about comfort with uncertainty. More materially, maybe: I’m still doing about the same. Walking with a walker occasionally, starting intense physical and occupational therapy to develop more mobility tomorrow. I have nerve pain in my hands but low doses of opioids treat it well.
[7/12/23, 17:18:16] Beverly Socher-Lerner: It's good to hear your voice and sensibilities that we love still shining through.

[7/12/23, 17:31:13] Esteban Kelly: Thanks everyone for sharing love and support for Peter here. I wanted to create a WhatsApp group to make it easier for Deanna and Peter to share updates in one place and reduce the labor of catching everyone up in different modes. I also wanted to foster a sense of community (which is already happening!) where we could express our love and show Peter how many people care so deeply about our buddy. So when you have a moment, (and I can be later this month or whenever) you're invited to share memories, funny stories, appreciations, and pics (the older the better) on this thread. For those of us far from LA, that might be one of the best things we can do for the moment. And thanks Peter for keeping us up to date on how things progress. Especially grateful to witness how you are finding disability justice helpful throughout this complex journey.
[7/12/23, 17:46:15] Peter Sachs Collopy: The trauma physicians validated my curiosity about whether I might have an underlying brain or heart condition that triggered the accident. A CT scan with a contrast fluid injected into the blood this morning was one of the strangest bodily experiences I’ve ever had. Literally energy being pumped into my body near my elbow, and feeling it flowing through. It is so so strange being a body, and so so strange being one that is a patient, and both are uncomfortable but  for me right now are mostly opportunities for sharing compassion and learning.
[7/12/23, 17:52:48] Peter Sachs Collopy: I also ordered an Apple Watch. I have felt pretty negatively about fitness tracking and notifications beyond the kind of bike trip mapping I use apps on my phone for. But heart rate monitoring and crash/fall detection seem really valuable to me right now, and I think worth a second thought to others as well. I had an episode yesterday of starting to faint while standing with a walker, and everyone here helped me safely get back to bed, but the risk of losing consciousness feels imminent and tools for recognizing that seem intriguing.

[7/14/23, 01:03:53] Peter Sachs Collopy: A latest reply to “how are you feeling?”: I am now in the rehab unit here at the hospital. It’s terrific; I’m spending lots of time with very skilled physical therapists and occupational therapists working on walking, balance, and other things about learning to move my body. It is of course strange to have to be so intentional about motion that used to be automatic, but that’s what it means to have a spinal injury: figuring out how to reconnect my brain to my right hand and foot after they have literally been partially severed. So it’s a really interesting learning experience.
[7/14/23, 02:10:47] Peter Sachs Collopy: For those interested in my peculiar way of processing trauma, I just sent a rather personal public records request to the City of South Pasadena:

Hello. A week ago, on July 6 between 6 and 7 pm, I was in a bicycle accident on Stoney Drive in front of South Pawsadena Dog Park. I am immensely grateful to EMTs or others who responded to a 911 call and found me unconscious there, then provided medical attention and transported me to Huntington Hospital. I have received tremendous care at the hospital, and although my memory of the incident is very limited, I am sure from the hospital records I have read that I did from EMTs as well.

Because I have so little memory of my accident, I am trying to learn as much as I can. Could you please share with me any documentation you have, such as an incident report or any photographs of me or my bicycle at the scene? Please let me know if you have a procedure for a formal public records request which would be helpful, or I would certainly appreciate whatever information you are able to share now.

In addition, could you please tell me what agency would be responsible for the record of the initiating 911 call from a witness reporting my accident? I would very much appreciate access to that record as well, again to understand as best I can the circumstances and deepen my appreciation for the caller, dispatcher, and crew who all worked to bring to to safety.

I have a certain professional interest in records as University Archivist at Caltech, and very much appreciate your assistance in helping me use public records to understand this life-changing event I have experienced. Please let me know whether any additional information would assist in identifying records pertinent to my request, or if there is another channel more appropriate for it.

[7/14/23, 06:19:54] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have said versions of this here and on the phone to some of you, but just wrote this in reply to a text from my uncle Dave about his own powerful physical therapy experiences: Thank you so much for this reflection! It fits so closely with what I’m experiencing, that life is about adaptation to circumstances. I’ve been talking with Deanna and others about the basic ways of engaging with pain and change in life: recognizing that harm is distributed partly arbitrarily and could thus come to any of us, or insist that one is different from others, or simply denial of the possibility of pain. The third has never felt available to me because I just think too much. The second has made me angrier the more I have studied the histories of eugenics and disability. (There’s also a nice version of that rejection in the Darwin quotation you use on your Facebook or somewhere, right?) So I feel like I had already settled on some kind of comfort with my body changing as others do before this accident, even though the specifics are a surprise and still feel mysterious.
[7/14/23, 06:23:00] Joanna Radin: This makes a lot of sense to me Peter!
[7/14/23, 06:36:31] Dave Collopy: ‎Dave Collopy joined using this group's invite link
[7/14/23, 06:53:03] Peter Sachs Collopy: Jo, I feel like this comfort with bodily change and difference is somewhere in the benefits of medical humanities that we can articulate to our students and colleagues! Being a full time patient is making me feel much more a historian of medicine.
[7/14/23, 06:55:17] Joanna Radin: For me, in what you said, it’s the coupling of curiousity and gentleness/care…taking pain seriously and not an epiphenomenon of knowledge
[7/14/23, 07:31:42] Peter Sachs Collopy: I wrote something to my Caltech Library colleagues which is among many other things an invitation to them to join us here:

Dear colleagues,

As I think you know, a week ago I had a pretty severe bicycling accident on my way home from work. The accident itself is a bit of a mystery; as far as I know, I wasn’t hit by a car or anything but nonetheless ended up hitting the ground with my head, and really only my head, at full speed.

I have some tendency to keep parts of my life experience away from Caltech Library, partly because I have found it easier to be a manager and archivist if I let others project some assumptions onto me rather than always expressing myself fully. In this situation, though, I’m finding that I want to share a lot of my experience of disability and being a patient, as well my uncertainty about what my body will be like in the future. I’m writing this paragraph in part to warn that the next one is a bit visceral; there’s a very serious but hidden injury involved.

I imagine my helmet effectively protected my skull, but my face was badly hurt; I didn’t break my nose or cheek bones, but I tore up the skin a lot and then got some very impressive plastic surgery in the ER. Also, the force also apparently travelled into my spine and fractured two neck vertebrae. Those in turn damaged the nerves in my spine, limiting my brain’s ability to communicate with parts of my body, particularly my right leg and hand.

There are two types of good news: First, for whatever reason I immediately felt comfortable with the idea that my body might never be the same as it was. I have some philosophical thoughts on why this feels okay, and I’ll probably share them in bits, but it also has felt closely tied to my work at Caltech with histories of eugenics and recognizing the dignity and validity of the lives of people with disabilities, with perceiving bodily difference without accepting impositions of hierarchy, and with the great accessibility work many colleagues have been pursuing in the library as well. The second type of good news, which I feel in some tension to the first, is that in the overall population of people with spinal injuries, I have retained a large amount of control over my body, and am rapidly learning to build up more control. I don’t know when or if I will walk without a walker, ride a bike, type, or handle a printed book as dexterously as I used to, but I might do all those things within months, or I might do some and adopt alternatives for others. I might even break with my existing habits of transportation in LA and buy a car!

The other good news is that Huntington Hospital has an excellent rehab program for spinal injury patients, so I’m here likely for a few weeks doing training with incredible physical and occupational therapists.

I really appreciate well wishes I have been hearing from Caltech! I also want to invite you, if you want, to join a WhatsApp group where I’m sharing some experiences with friends and family:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/KNDWyNwGOPo6ZZaKtXhxRT

To circle back: Part of my reluctance to bring all parts of my life into my Caltech Library work has been not wanting to take advantage of a role as a manager and burden others. It feels safer and more comfortable for me to share this emotional journey with friends from other parts of my life. But I’ve been thinking about it for a week, and I would like you with me as well if you want to come along.

I have also been feeling very social. I’m right down the road from Caltech, so if you’re local and would like to visit, please feel welcome to ask if now is good whenever; my cell phone number is 216-544-1564. If I have therapy or need to nap, I’ll of course say so or just not reply. Or please check in around 8 am, because I get my PT and OT schedule for the day each morning.


Sincerely,

Peter

[7/14/23, 20:24:38] Allegra Giovine: it is awesome to see your thought process and how you deploy your skills.  it is a great way to navigate the world (and often so challenging to do well in the "life" portion).
[7/14/23, 21:27:16] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have had periods of depending totally on walking and transit to get around in LA when shoulder pain prevented me from riding a bike. It only felt worth it because it felt temporary, though. If I can’t ride for a long time, I might get a car. What should I get if so? Part of me thinks that since I have done fine with the cargo capacity of a road bike so far, I could be impractical and get a Miata. Or I could get something that can carry a bit more, including friends; maybe a Honda Civic? Manual or automatic might depend on how my right hand dexterity develops, but I think I might already be able to drive manual now since shifting is a pretty gross motion. I guess I’ll start doing some total cost of ownership math; the last time I did, in 2020, the subjective value of a car to me was less than the cost of parking alone, so it was easy to decide not to buy one, but it might now really augment my limited mobility if it stays limited.
[7/14/23, 21:49:19] Karl Jones: I’m on team Miata, personally
[7/14/23, 22:00:14] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah, having a Miata as the only car in a household seems almost like a kind of anti-nuclear family statement. The only downsides are not expanding grocery shopping much—but passenger seat plus trunk is still more than a cart, I bet—and not being great for offering friends rides. If it were actually cheaper, I feel like it would be an easier decision.
[7/14/23, 22:26:31] Lisa Cooper Vest: We bought our teeny Ford Fiesta in 2014 because we had no money, but we have really made it work and I kind of love the fact that we have this ugly little blue car in image-conscious Los Angeles almost a decade later.
[7/14/23, 22:29:39] Lisa Cooper Vest: (That said, I'm sure it would be more fun to drive a Miata lol)
[7/15/23, 01:55:53] Peter Sachs Collopy: I like this with a sort of occult meaning to “weird” too. My accident certainly could have been caused by a weird door opening in the road. Dave, have you come across any of Erik Davis’ writing? I think you might like it. He uses “weird” in this sort of specific way in his book High Weirdness, which I haven’t really read. Caltech folks, Davis also wrote two chapters about our own occultist rocket engineer Jack Parsons. https://techgnosis.com, https://techgnosis.com/babalon-rising/, https://techgnosis.com/babalon-launching/
[7/15/23, 03:52:41] Beverly Socher-Lerner: Yeah... I've definitely driven my car A LOT more then I intended this year in the six-ish months where I had really limited mobility. Still working on getting a parking placard for the next time I'm that limited. It's really good peace of mind that I can still get to work and do basic things for myself with a car that I really couldn't have without. We were car free until about three years ago. Bought an old, low mileage Camry, and it's been great.
[7/15/23, 04:50:40] Ed Underhill: As someone who recently did a bunch of car research (and had to buy during the height of pandemic used car shortage when my old car got totaled) I am always down to talk car options. I definitely have Thoughts, and Opinions about good car models ☺️
[7/15/23, 04:53:12] Ed Underhill: A Prius has been great for gas mileage in a city with wildly expensive gas, but there are a lot of good hybrid options around these days, and they’ve been around for long enough that you can often find a decent low mileage one at a decent price (often still more than a gas car, but for me that was worth it).
[7/15/23, 05:20:59] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you! My instinct is that I wouldn’t put enough miles on a car to make batteries worthwhile either financially or ethically, but it’s hard to know that for sure. And I guess my commute alone might be a pretty consistent 75 miles per week at some point, plus more medical and PT trips. Biking has also been an important mental health activity for me since moving to LA, so if/when I can’t I need to develop substitutes, and that might include driving to hikes, swimming, and other kinds of exercise I can do.
[7/15/23, 05:25:46] Ed Underhill: This is part of why I’ve bought used cars so far - it’s harder for me to ethically justify the environmental costs of a new one. It’s true that hybrids do the worst on short trips, because they never really get warmed up enough for the battery to take on a bunch of the load. So possibly a gas car with good mileage would be just fine for you (we had a 2005 Corolla when we first moved to LA, and it was great; I only replaced it because we inherited a Prius from a family member and I was commuting ~40 miles/day at that point)
[7/15/23, 05:28:24] Ed Underhill: Toyota and Honda both make good cars imo, and Hyundai and Kia have gotten better and better. Subaru is also good, but only worth the price if you’re regularly driving in mud or snow or climbing a mountain 😆
[7/15/23, 05:33:14] Beverly Socher-Lerner: I still miss my Subaru. One time Naomi had no option but to hit a deer 😭. We had two little kids in the car at the time. The little one stayed asleep. The big one calmly asked why the road was so bumpy. We got the car (tank) checked out, and it didn't even need body work! 🤯
[7/15/23, 05:39:25] Peter Sachs Collopy: If I don’t need to drive to the Bay Area or whatever, and if I can get an electric charging parking spot, I also could just do electric. There a 2019 VW e-Golf on Car Max that sounds perfectly decent. Or a new Chevy Bolt? It looks like they’ve just had a big price drop.
[7/15/23, 05:41:47] Ed Underhill: Yeah as long as the slower charging rate works for you, I think both of those are supposed to be perfectly decent options. Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro also have electric options that are supposed to be good (but probably pricier).
[7/15/23, 05:43:21] Peter Sachs Collopy: I think I’ve driven carshare Bolts, and they felt really good.
[7/15/23, 05:43:45] Ed Underhill: I’ve heard mixed things about the comfort of the Bolt’s front seats so I guess for recovery comfort, that might be a consideration, but if you’ve driven and felt fine, maybe that’s all good!
[7/15/23, 05:46:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: Oh yeah! Seat comfort should be a big factor to evaluate for both me and Deanna.
[7/15/23, 05:49:01] Peter Sachs Collopy: We are a 100% recovering from surgery household. (Of humans, at least. Babka beat us to this major surgery experience by several years, and she seems able to sit on anything.)
[7/15/23, 05:52:36] Peter Sachs Collopy: I do wonder if this bike accident was me having no option but to hit some mammal with my bike, and then hitting a fence instead. My bike, alas, definitely didn’t have the mass and density to keep the passenger so calm during the collision!
[7/15/23, 06:04:45] Peter Sachs Collopy: I know some of my memory loss is due to being concussed and unconscious, but I’m mostly missing about two hours and I think I was conscious for all but about ten minutes. I think most of that time is my brain protecting my mind from pain. And I think therefore the first night of this on July 6 was a lot more psychologically traumatizing for Deanna than it was for me.
[7/15/23, 06:30:53] Daniel Frishberg: I loved my 2019 Honda Civic, both as a first car and as a really good car in its own right. It was reliable and easy to drive and to maneuver, had a great turning radius, and felt decently smooth on the road. The acceleration was good (IIRC it was a turbo), and it handled the grapevine ok with four people and an insane amount of luggage. I could also drive it on a narrow, unpaved stretch in Kings Canyon without much difficulty. The trunk was sufficiently spacious for my needs (including putting my bike in when needed).
[7/15/23, 06:32:31] Daniel Frishberg: It was a lease. That being said, if I were leasing or buying a new car now, I guess I'd probably get an electric.
[7/15/23, 06:33:56] Peter Sachs Collopy: Civics do seem to me like they have the right design decisions in gas cars.
[7/15/23, 06:34:26] Peter Sachs Collopy: What is your current car?
[7/15/23, 06:34:32] Daniel Frishberg: Also, i paid $210/mo. for the car and about $90/mo. for insurance.
[7/15/23, 06:34:59] Daniel Frishberg: 2014 VW Jetta (diesel)
[7/15/23, 06:35:07] Ed Underhill: Insurance in LA is kind of a beast but AAA has been great for us so far and far more affordable than other options
[7/15/23, 06:36:23] Peter Sachs Collopy: That seems very doable. Parking will also cost about that much where we live, though. One thing that has made our apartment so affordable for us for 8 years is that parking is separate and we haven’t paid for it.
[7/15/23, 06:36:30] Daniel Frishberg: It was a gift. It's also a manual. It was implicated in Dieselgate and has been retrofitted.
[7/15/23, 06:37:11] Peter Sachs Collopy: I’m trying to remember if I have driven that car. It sounds fun.
[7/15/23, 06:37:42] Daniel Frishberg: The civic also uses regular gas (as I think most sedans do?) And I found myself spending about $100/mo or so on that? But I was driving like 8k-10k miles a year
[7/15/23, 06:38:22] Daniel Frishberg: I spent way less on gas in 2020 of course
[7/15/23, 06:39:01] Daniel Frishberg: The biggest downside of having a car is that I ride my bike less because the car is so convenient
[7/15/23, 06:39:06] Peter Sachs Collopy: Any amount of money on gas feels like a lot to me because the last time I drove a lot was 2003, when I remember it consistently being $10 per week.
[7/15/23, 06:40:10] Daniel Frishberg: Which is bad for my health actually
[7/15/23, 07:03:44] Kara Whatley: I had a 2016 Honda Civic, and I still sort of miss that car. It was the perfect size! But in LA I’ve been obsessed with a car that sits higher on the road so that I can see better/more. We have a VW Tiguan, which I love. But Edmunds really likes the VW Taos for compact SUVs. They may be too new for good used options, though. Also, we got our Costco membership to buy gas at their stations.
[7/15/23, 07:23:37] Dave Collopy: Peter, my 80 year old friend, Tom Johnson, drives a 1990 Mazda Miata and loves it, manual transmission and all. He and his son, Tony, explore many an off-beaten path to Midwestern destinations at least once a week. Their day-tripping excursions can tell you every flat thing you’d ever want to know about the State of Indiana or any hilly thing you could care about in the city of Cincinnati or the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee. 

If you decide on a Miata, I think you and Deanna will be able to handle the groceries in your little streamlined vehicle, even with two people in the car. Tom is a bit of a nut when it comes to taking good care of his vehicles so his 34 year old classic Miata looks like it’s still in showroom condition since the day he bought it. 

Please note that their excursions even included some slippery winter driving in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
——————————
I was unfamiliar with the writings of Eric Davis until you just brought his work to my attention. Thanks for the recommendation. I will soon read some of his “weird” writing.
[7/15/23, 07:43:02] Allegra Giovine: the weight of the battery factor really depends on the kind of car.  EVs are of course the worst; plug-in hybrids are better but still bad; hybrids are not actually so bad compared to normal car battery needs.  this is my understanding as a non-car expert who just soaks up a lot of secondhand knowledge from my partner while he is procrastinating on his work by telling me random facts...

also, we have a Honda Fit and it's a great little car. unfortunately a couple of years ago they shut down their operations for the US market. you can still get them in other parts of the world.  the US market is not giving us the best options... on cars and I'm sure a lot of other things!
[7/15/23, 07:52:52] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah. When I thought about buying a car moving to LA eight years ago, a Fit was high on my list, so I’ve watched them disappear here since.
[7/15/23, 08:02:40] Peter Sachs Collopy: The Tiguan sounds like a great version of the thing it is. I think part of my stubbornness about transportation technology is resisting the whole higher chassis SUV thing, though, even though they have clearly won in the US. They seem like a massive regulatory mistake to me, producing all kinds of greater risks with a benefit that is mostly just visibility and presence when surrounded by other vehicles like them. I’d rather be a little less safe myself and make other people be responsible for not crushing me than the other way around. I think a Civic makes sense to me that way!
[7/15/23, 08:04:28] Kara Whatley: The 2016 Civic had a right turn camera, great for noticing cyclists.  Highly recommend the Civic. (It was the first car I named I liked it that much!)
[7/15/23, 08:59:05] Peter Sachs Collopy: I am loving all the thoughtful car reflections! Thank you!
[7/15/23, 09:01:10] Carlin Wing: i think a miata sounds exactly right. i moved back to LA on the heels of two years of rehabbing a back injury that had made sitting a tricky endeavor and was really nervous about driving 35 miles each way to work with all the sitting and the asymmetry of right foot gas pedal pressing so i paid a lot of attention to seat comfort and adjustability. prius was good for that but i wasn’t into having no sight through the back window (i now think i would have adjusted to the video view but in that moment my memory of LA highway driving made it seem
bonkers not to see out the back). i ended up with a subaru which was great for seat and wheel adjustability and works for hauling large quantities of strange art materials halfway across the country on a somewhat regular basis. but i got the smallest one for some semblance of ok gas mileage. in hindsight, if you have a car with enough headroom to add adjustments (a wedge cushion, lumbar support, etc) then you can mod the seat as needed or even sub in a seat that works for you. if i were to do it now i’d probably get an electric and solve longer travel another way. and if i didn’t have a long commute to campus, miata all the way!
[7/15/23, 09:07:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: I also appreciate all the encouragement of what feels to me like an impractical attraction to Miatas. They are pretty much the only cars that make me happy when I see them in the world, and that should count for something. A Civic Type R makes me happy too, but I don’t feel good about spending a bunch more than on a regular Civic to turn it into more of a toy.
[7/15/23, 09:31:31] Peter Sachs Collopy: I like Miatas of all ages, but given the giant vehicles they’re surrounded by on the road, I might favor a recent one for more safety features.
[7/15/23, 09:40:22] ~ Jenny #214: My vote for the Chevy Bolt! That’s what I’m eyeing, for what it’s worth.
[7/15/23, 09:53:23] Mog Youngberg: I feel this way also about VW Cabriolets
[7/15/23, 09:53:50] Mog Youngberg: Also, as another friend group says when we get deep in the nerdy weeds, “I love this bar.”
[7/15/23, 09:56:26] Mog Youngberg: I am reading these conversations and thinking about the time YB said you were unethical.
[7/15/23, 10:11:03] Peter Sachs Collopy: Mog, I have not thought about that in… 15 years! Yes everyone, a college administrator didn’t like me for being a troublemaker student, and now I am a college administrator.
[7/15/23, 10:12:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: The great Harlan Wilson, on the other hand, told me around the same time that I would become a college administrator.
[7/15/23, 10:27:20] Rand: We got a Chevy Bolt in October, which we call the Micromachine. Deanna has ridden in it and when you’re ready you can check it out too! Have been really happy with it so far, it’s been comfortable even for two Large People (Karl’s head hit the roof of the Nissan Leaf we test drove), and it now qualifies for the federal tax cut alongside the price drop. That said, I am pretty sure they’re discontinuing it but the EUV seems pretty similar in size and shape (to the point where once I accidentally unplugged an EUV parked next to our Bolt in the Caltech garage thinking it was ours oop)
[7/15/23, 10:28:29] Nicolás Wey Gómez: I vote for hydrogen fuel cell cars five years from now. Toyota and BMW are on the chase.
[7/15/23, 10:40:16] Rand: Wondering if you’d be able to get discounted or free parking with a disability permit. For what it’s worth a monthly permit at the Caltech garage where they have free charging is $48/month for “green” vehicles, which is about the cost of one tank of gas these days.
[7/15/23, 12:43:31] Esteban Kelly: This is my truth.

[7/15/23, 18:13:31] Cameron Brinitzer: I think this is a truly fascinating and terrifying phenomenon. And I like the idea of brain protecting mind. I once sustained a concussion while playing soccer in my teenage years. My memory starts, as far as I was told and recall, about an hour after the injury (while falling, my forehead and somebody’s knee collided). I have always wondered about that gap in memory and what was happening in terms of both mind and brain. It’s uncanny and yet maybe merciful or simply a necessary part. It’s also a little strange how clear my memory is of the moment it begins again. I was sitting on the bench and said to my teammates, “i feel like i just woke up from a really weird nap” and they told me that I’d been saying that repeatedly for 45 minutes. Does your memory start again distinctly at some point?
[7/15/23, 19:57:20] Peter Sachs Collopy: My start to my memory is not that crisp. The first thing I remember is a conversation with someone outdoors about calling Deanna because I was injured. I don’t remember an ambulance, the specific location, or the faces or uniforms or voices of the EMTs, though. Then I remember my face being stitched up, and I remember it as sewing, as someone working with a textile that was also me. I don’t actually remember the face of the surgeon, but I do remember that he didn’t actually work here at the hospital, and asked me to visit him at his office in two weeks to have stitches removed. Then the things I remember are consequences: I could not stand, which I don’t really remember (but which was absolutely harrowing for Deanna, because the medical staff had assumed I could based on a CT scan and left her with me, so she was first and alone in understanding how bad things were), so there were emergency arrangements for an MRI. I think I remember more starting with the preparation for the MRI, including explaining that removing my earring, which had been in for 16 years, would require pliers or metal shears. By that point it was pretty late at night, though, so I think I’m actually mostly missing more than a couple hours.
[7/15/23, 20:01:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have a lot of memories of conversations without remembering my interlocutors that night, and some also the following when I had surgery. Some of this is also anesthesia.
[7/15/23, 20:08:06] Peter Sachs Collopy: Friday evening, eight nights ago, I had spinal surgery. When I was in the recovery room and came to, I was overstimulated by all the noise and conversation. How many other patients were in the room, I asked someone attending to me? There were five of us, they said. Based on the dialogues around me, I was sure the others were not actually there recovering from surgery, but were rather engaged in psychedelic psychotherapy. I was the only surgery patient. I don’t remember what any of them said, but it does still make some sense to me: the actual post-surgery patients in the room were indeed high, and we all might have been ranting about our emotional experiences; that space might sound very much like, and be, a particularly harsh medicalized psychedelic set and setting. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/17/23, 03:52:58] Peter Sachs Collopy: It was a week of odd bike collision before my big crash for me: on July 4, two days earlier, I rode into a wasp, which became trapped in my helmet and stung my forehead. Fortunately it turns out my reaction to a wasp sting, my first in decades, is mild. But it has certainly felt like a July of too much collision overall for me!

[7/17/23, 16:04:52] Peter Sachs Collopy: Weekdays are more intensively scheduled with physical and occupational therapy than weekends here, so it has been a busy day. Right now the hardest part might be this: I am at the same time learning to live in a body that can’t do certain things, and learning to do those things again. And because of whatever combination I have of modest nerve damage, strong neuroplasticity, and lots of martial arts experience applying instruction to my bodily movement, I’m learning how to walk again very fast while at the same time getting used to not walking as I used to. It’s a complicated emotional experience.
[7/17/23, 16:07:14] Chris Boyd: Do you think the tae kwon do experience has helped?
[7/17/23, 16:30:03] ~ Jonah: As fast or slow as it might seem to be going, I am imagining this is going to be a nice gradual path to any sense of new true normalcy in your body/mind. Breathe deep, feel it all 💜
[7/17/23, 16:52:48] Peter Sachs Collopy: Big time. I think my body awareness is strong, and when a physical therapist says that I’m moving my foot in a round motion or snapping my knee, I recognize what they mean and adjust pretty immediately. I think lots of physical disciplines would help in this way, and for me Tae Keon Do has.
[7/17/23, 16:59:07] Peter Sachs Collopy: It is! I do feel like my right leg is changing faster than I’m emotionally prepared for, though, like it’s trying to continually challenge me with change and not let me become accustomed to any one kind of motion. My right hand, in contrast, seems more consistent, and my four fingers are stubbornly moving together, so there is some stability in my experience of my body there.
[7/17/23, 19:51:59] Ed Underhill: Wait a minute. How have we never talked about martial arts?! (I have also done a lot of it!)
[7/18/23, 06:15:36] Peter Sachs Collopy: Jonah Matranga, who has joined us here, is a singer-songwriter whose shows I’ve been going to for about 23 years at venues in Cleveland, Philly, and LA. His music is a big presence in my life. In particular, you all joining me for this experience of disability and healing is a good occasion for “I Really Love Yr Company,” because I do. https://jonahmatranga.bandcamp.com/track/i-really-love-yr-company-2
[7/18/23, 06:20:59] Fred Collopy: Beautiful! Thanks Peter (and Jonah).
[7/18/23, 06:23:12] Peter Sachs Collopy: And our car conversation definitely has me hearing Jonah’s anthem “Lukewarm”: “A house in the burbs and a bitchin’ SUV is how I’m never gonna wind up,” “I never wanna say my best days are behind me,” “There is a summer, it’s all the time for every one of us.” I feel this song every day, but really really now. https://newendoriginal.bandcamp.com/track/lukewarm

[7/18/23, 11:10:04] Ed Underhill: A few little thoughts on car stuff, in case it’s of interest: I was in Columbus over the weekend for work, and a friend carted a bunch of us authors around in her Honda Fit. She proudly showed off that the front seat could fold totally flat, and the rear seats could fold UP in addition to down, which gave a lot of options for carrying things. Another friend said she had managed to fit a fully assembled IKEA bookcase in her Fit, though noted her car with leather seats did not fold totally flat for the passenger front seat.

On the Civic front, I’ve noticed that some are hatchbacks, and while that does mean the trunk is a higher reach to close when it’s open, I do find the hatchback option REALLY useful on my Prius.

[7/18/23, 17:45:12] Catherine Geard: I had a car that did that. It was a Dodge Caliber and it could fit a surf board or skis in it with the front seat pushed down flat. It was discontinued. But I hear the Fit is a great car too. Peppy.
[7/19/23, 04:28:30] Allegra Giovine: Peter, any info back from South Pasadena?
[7/19/23, 04:31:44] Allegra Giovine: I also wanted to circle back to this.  it is strange being a body (I usually say "in a body" but I think your wording is a little more faithful to what we're dealing with).  anyway, did you learn anything else from this CT scan or other diagnostics about possible underlying conditions?
[7/19/23, 07:10:31] Peter Sachs Collopy: This one is anticlimactic so far: I got an autoreply saying that they don’t monitor their email and that I should call them instead. I thought about asking someone to format the email as a letter and print it out and mail it to them, but I decided that fire stations are more telephone kinds of places, so I should call. I haven’t yet, though. I did get a letter from the police department giving me four months to claim my bike, and it’s nice to have that timeline clarified because the cop I talked with said I had years and I didn’t believe him.
[7/19/23, 07:28:00] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah, I feel ever more strongly about anti-Cartesian language, something I think I have learned from Deanna. It isn’t a container for me that is changing through injury and rehab, it is me. That said, I also think I would feel much less comfortable in this whole process if the neurological symptoms were more cognitive, if my thinking felt different than I am used to rather than my motion, so I’m not as consistent an anti-Cartesian as I want to be. I wish I were as comfortable with the idea of mental disability as I am with physical, because I want to respect myself and others through such disability, but I know it does feel different to me. Time spent in universities and other cultures of supposed intellectual meritocracy has made it harder for me to imagine my mind working differently. But in my particular situation, if anything my cognition feels sharper than before the accident. I think that is the result of a focus on this experience and getting to neglect other aspects of my life, especially my job, in order to just learn about my body all the time. But it feels like a heightening of thinking which feels really good.
[7/19/23, 07:36:26] Peter Sachs Collopy: We didn’t learn anything from additional heart and brain scans about any underlying medical condition that could have caused the accident. There’s nothing to suggest I was at risk for a medical emergency before the crash, or had one. I do now know more about my heart and its risk factors than most 38 year olds, but nothing alarming.
[7/19/23, 07:37:54] Esteban Kelly: You're looking great, Peter!
[7/19/23, 07:39:38] Peter Sachs Collopy: And that was ten days with no real shower! I look even better now that I’ve had one!
[7/19/23, 07:41:25] Chris Boyd: That’s good news about the scans! As much as it might be satisfying to have a reason for the crash, I’m very glad you haven’t found one indicating wider problems.
[7/19/23, 07:45:28] Ed Underhill: I don’t know anything about anti-Cartesian language and all that, but I have thought a lot recently about mental changes and how uncomfortable and weird they can be, as someone who has recently been trying to let myself acknowledge how much my brain changes the way it processes things when I have an intense migraine attack. There’s the obvious - like not being able to deal with light and noise - but I’ve been working on understanding and accepting other changes that I feel like aren’t talked about as much or understood as well: I can’t follow directions or process multiple pieces of information at once. I can’t read a recipe to make dinner; sometimes I can’t even read a book. It’s a very weird experience that feels completely opposite to how my brain normally functions. It’s honestly only through talking with a friend with ME and hearing her talk about brain fog that I was even able to kind of accept the changes in my brain and let myself work with them rather than against them during migraine attacks.
[7/19/23, 07:54:24] Peter Sachs Collopy: So most likely causes of the crash, in my current thinking: 
(Can I make this a High Fidelity style top 5 list? I get to be tasteless about my own suffering.)
1. A car drove me off the road, but maybe didn’t actually hit me, and I hit the curb or a fence next to it.
2. An animal ran across the road, and I swerved to miss it and hit the curb or fence. I am totally overly reactive to animals as both a driver and a cyclist, and this feels like a really me way to wreck my spine.
3. I hit some inanimate object in the road, like a rock or big stick or pothole. This feels unlikely to me; there was plenty of light and this is a part of biking I’m good at. But I was going fast.
4. I had a flat front tire and didn’t notice it, and the wheel wobbled out from under me as I took the curve. Again, this feels unlikely to me and I think I could have handled it safely, but it does happen to people and I am a person. I kind of think I would have fallen more on my side than my head in this case.
5. I had some lightheadedness, lost my vision, and rode too straight rather that following the curve of the road, and hit the curb or fence. I have had lightheadness and some loss of vision when I pause intensive exercise since I was a teenager, but I don’t think I ever have on a moving bike.
[7/19/23, 07:57:16] Peter Sachs Collopy: Our brains as well as our bodies (our brains as parts of our bodies) work differently under different circumstances. It is hard given how stable we expect our selves to be; I think for me part of the answer is just that “me” is not as consistent a being as I have been told. I might be getting a little abstract?
[7/19/23, 07:57:50] Ed Underhill: I think this is a really useful way to think of it though!

[7/19/23, 08:20:35] Peter Sachs Collopy: I had an hour long conversation with my nurse Ronnie last night about how I feel about disability and recovery, and how thinking about disability, including academically and in archival work as a custodian of eugenic sterilization records, has somehow prepared me for experiencing disability better than I could have anticipated. I feel incredibly fortunate to have so much intellectual context and some concrete knowledge of others’ experiences. People have disabilities, and I am a people, so this whole experience feels like part of being human.
[7/19/23, 08:21:15] Micki Collopy: Hello Peter…it took me a little longer to get this set up but I think this is success.  You continue to be in my thoughts (and yes prayers) along with a group of many others.  I pray each and every day lends you the strength to continue your healing journey knowing you are not alone.  Please feel my energy topped off with love!  Share hugs! *but pick and choose who you share them with!
[7/19/23, 08:37:18] ~ Tommy: I was having thoughts along these lines when reading Peter's description about the tension between recovering some control relatively quickly and the acceptance of a new state of being. Sometimes present bias leads us to think we are in a constant state and must accept it forever, but recognizing that everything is in process and always changing might help with becoming too attached to any particular state.

[7/19/23, 09:58:38] Kitty Collopy: Unfortunately I am not privy to the entire history of this conversation but, I’m assuming your ( Peter) approach is both deeply rooted in the knowledge of your own body with a sense of comedic relief! I’m trying to catch up through snippets of previous conversations! I also think in John Cusack’s voice on occasion!!!
[7/19/23, 17:38:29] Dave Collopy: I’m not dismissing the value in analyzing the particulars of a ‘High Fidelity’ type top five list, Peter. But, at best, I think an answer gets you in the right ballpark with little information that can help you understand the whole story. The crash itself would remain a mystery to all, with the possible exception of an eye witness. And even then you would only know one person’s perspective and that perspective could be tainted by a countless lack of details depending on what they were doing and thinking at the time this surprising crash suddenly took place in their field of vision. 

And yet there may be great value in seeking to understand this mystery.
[7/19/23, 18:10:35] Peter Sachs Collopy: I do wonder what I will remember or realize when I return to the location of the accident, since some people say that can induce remembering. Or what I will learn if I ride a bike down that hill again, which I hope I will eventually.

Just call me Watson, my dear Mr. Holmes.
[7/20/23, 03:14:59] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yesterday I tried using a laptop again for the first time. I was surprised that I could type some with my right hand. Most of the force came from my wrist, not my finger muscles, but by pivoting my wrist slightly I could point the force at a specific finger and thus key.

I’m really interested, though, in one-handed typing techniques. These aren’t just useful for people with disabilities, but also for anyone who wants to type and mouse at the same time. None of them seem to achieve the speed of skilled two-handed typing—spreading the work among more fingers really does help—but they do seem to regularly get well above half that speed. I think a few people here share my curiosity about alternative computer interfaces and accessibility enough you might want to read about this stuff too. Here is the most comprehensive information I’ve found: https://kpronline.com/blog/12-considerations-for-choosing-a-one-handed-typing-method/, https://kpronline.com/blog/your-guide-to-10-one-hand-typing-options/.

The most appealing methods to me don’t actually involve any new gear; one is typing on a standard QWERTY keyboard but resting my left hand on the middle FGHJ keys, and the other is staying on ASDF and using software to mirror the keyboard and do both hands’ work with the left. If either of those feels too straining, I might learn the left-handed Dvorak layout, which is actually designed for this situation.

Dictation would probably be faster (even than two-handed typing for most people, I’m reading!), but I feel like typing might integral to my thinking, not just a channel of communication, so I think I care about doing it regardless. And taking notes in meetings feels like a context in which dictation isn’t available too. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/20/23, 03:53:27] Allegra Giovine: have you thought about whether you could comfortably use your right hand in a more limited way while typing?  like just using one finger from your right hand to operate on a limited number of keys.  that might really boost what your left hand could do.

this reddit post captures one person's achievements with this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/typing/comments/xo2pbl/i_type_with_my_left_hand_and_one_finger_from_my/

though I was thinking more about using right hand for a functional key or two that could speed up a primarily left-handed approach.

I agree that typing does something for the thinking/writing process.  it is cool that there are so many options for thoughts/words to text, including the dictation route, which also has a lot to offer to the thought capturing process.
[7/20/23, 04:03:30] Peter Sachs Collopy: Interesting! I do think that 80–95 wpm is faster than I’ve read about anyone doing one-handed, but that specific person’s approach sounds so chaotic.… Using the right hand consistently for modifiers would certainly be useful, and does sound doable to me.

I’m just becoming consciously aware now of how I am typing on the iPhone  mounted at an angle on a stand which has been my main computer for the last two weeks, and it turns out I am typing entirely using my left thumb. It definitely slows me down, but it’s not too bad, especially when I remember to use autocomplete. I suppose I usually text with two thumbs, and I just substituted the left for the right. Now that I’m conscious of it, it turns out I can use both thumbs, because I can control my right thumb mostly from my wrist, so that feels like a bit of acceleration. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/20/23, 04:08:11] Allegra Giovine: agree about that sounding chaotic, also probably bad for developing carpal tunnel.  apparently a lot of people on that subreddit type that way (touch type left hand, index finger or middle finger right hand).  I was born in 83 and learned touch typing in elementary school.  It was always curious to me as a kid that my dad (a computer guy) couldn't touch type.
[7/20/23, 04:09:02] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have talked very little with the occupational therapists here about typing so far. It seems like it isn’t actually a skill relevant to most of their patient population, who are mostly retirement-age. I think relatively few people who go through this rehab are actually preparing for work in addition to home life. I do think I will have interesting conversations with them about typing now that I’ve done some reading. Regardless, they will be very happy that I’m finding ways to incorporate my right hand some; it is sometimes easier to just rely on my left for things like eating, and they’re pushing me to incorporate my right in order to exercise it and give it opportunities to learn new motions.
[7/20/23, 04:15:20] Peter Sachs Collopy: When I started doing homeschooling in fifth grade, I did Mavis Beacon first thing every morning. It was one of the most traditional parts of my education in a way, scheduled and with a prescribed, if software-based, curriculum. One attraction of the FGHJ method for me is that it looks like there’s a website with typing games for learning it, and I would probably enjoy the typing games. (https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/) My own dad, a computer guy as well, credits failing Latin and being forced to take summer school typing in high school with a lot of his success. (Is that an accurate recounting, Fred?)
[7/20/23, 04:16:41] Peter Sachs Collopy: I am a little anxious about increased risk of repetitive stress injury with one-handed typing. And also with all this wrist-intensive thumb typing. I will ask the OTs about it!
[7/20/23, 04:30:03] Fred Collopy: It is accurate! I needed a quarter credit to stay with my homeroom.
[7/20/23, 06:15:04] ~ Tommy: My dad learned the FGHJ method for himself, mainly out of curiosity, I think. He also uses a Morse code keyboard on his phone so he doesn't have to look at it while typing. I, myself learned two-handed Dvorak once, but that caused Qwerty to be shoved aside in my brain and I couldn't use other computers then. There are certainly lots of options.
[7/20/23, 06:46:42] Peter Sachs Collopy: It does feel like the big advantage of FGHJ is that I could sit down at other people’s computers and use it. I’ll give it a try!
[7/20/23, 06:57:47] Lisa Cooper Vest: I also did Mavis Beacon as part of my homeschool curriculum!
[7/20/23, 07:18:53] Laine Nooney: Love that this Peter wellness chat has a software history element 👀

[7/20/23, 07:35:41] Elaine LaFay: That's amazing! I didn’t know much about the person Mavis Beacon, thanks for that link. I also did Mavis Beacon typing lessons as a kid and was extremely into it. In a very nerdy anecdote, my partner and I initially bonded over a shared pastime of typeracing on https://play.typeracer.com/. We used to play hoping to spot the other in a competition. I use qwerty but I have friends who claim that they type faster and more efficiently on Dvorak, however.

[7/20/23, 07:49:33] Lisa Cooper Vest: I was today years old when I, a person who has taught dozens of lectures about the composer Dvorak, learned about the Dvorak keyboard layout
[7/20/23, 07:50:54] Rob Nowicki: That’s so cool! Dvorak and Mussorgsky are my favorite composers and I’ve been waiting for years for a movie to be made about either. I’d love any book reccos on his life
[7/20/23, 07:56:30] Lisa Cooper Vest: Rob, there is a recent book in the Oxford Keynotes series by Douglas Shadle about Dvorak's 9th history, and it's great. Not a biography, more like a cultural history of how this particular composition had such an impact, but it does provide some great context. The essay collection Dvorak and his World is also great. On Musorgsky (one of my favorites!) the expert is/was Richard Taruskin. His book is a classic (and a pretty deep dive), but he also wrote several good pieces for the New York Times that are accessible online.

[7/20/23, 08:47:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: Lisa, I think you know that your knowledge of Dvorak is not the dimension of your work about which I am most excited. (Others, ask Lisa about demonic possession, music, film, and bodily permeability, my favorite topic at the moment, or about political uses of classical music in Cold War Poland.) But I am so delighted my friends are finding their common interests here! More of that please all!
[7/20/23, 08:52:01] ~ Tommy: Peter, is your sleep schedule disrupted because of something related to the accident and rehabilitation or are you normally awake at very early morning west coast hours? (noticed your posting times here)
[7/20/23, 08:58:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you for asking! I normally wake up at 7. It might be disrupted partly because nursing staff wake me up to give me meds and take my vitals and partly because I have to sleep on me back with my neck brace. But I think there’s something else going on, especially last night. I felt intensely excited about my brother visiting—which he is, and it is very exciting!—but to the point of not sleeping. So I wonder if one of my many meds, maybe the anticonvulsant gabipentin, might be making be a little manic? I have been fortunate not to experience any depression at all since my injury, and I’ve been thinking out loud here about why, but on the flip side I think you can all see I have a lot of energy.
[7/20/23, 08:59:19] Peter Sachs Collopy: Fortunately, last night is the only night so far I really haven’t slept enough.
[7/20/23, 09:00:02] Peter Sachs Collopy: And I did still sleep half the night, but yes, I was awake a lot!
[7/20/23, 09:00:45] ~ Tommy: I'm glad to hear that it is uncommon, knowing how reparative sleep is
[7/20/23, 09:05:31] Peter Sachs Collopy: I’m gonna make sure I talk with my doctor about this today. You asked the right question to hear it all first!
[7/20/23, 09:05:33] Daniel Frishberg: Sleep deprivation can also cause dysregulation that might feel like hypomania
[7/20/23, 09:06:16] Daniel Frishberg: But it sounds like you're mostly resting pretty well
[7/20/23, 09:07:12] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah. I’m going to nap some today too, and I have been successful at napping every time I’ve tried here.
[7/20/23, 09:08:18] Peter Sachs Collopy: I do think I have a sleep deficit overall, though, so that makes sense, Daniel. I was being woken up a lot for meds the first ten days or so.
[7/20/23, 09:10:52] Daniel Frishberg: Is the gabapentin for pain?
[7/20/23, 09:11:07] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah, for nerve pain.
[7/20/23, 09:11:19] Daniel Frishberg: I would be surprised if it caused anything resembling mania, but obviously neither of us is a physician
[7/20/23, 09:11:29] Peter Sachs Collopy: It’s funny because we give it to Babka as a sedative.
[7/20/23, 09:12:04] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah. I think it’s just one of the more brain-affecting drugs I’m on.
[7/20/23, 09:12:04] Daniel Frishberg: Yes I've seen Marvin zonked out on it
[7/20/23, 09:12:35] Daniel Frishberg: If you are concerned about feeling too activated and don't feel like gabapentin is helping with that, you could also ask for benzodiazepines. Some doctors are squirrelly about them because of addictive potential, but I think they're fucking amazing for calming shit down.
[7/20/23, 09:13:14] Daniel Frishberg: But based on the messages in this thread I don't pick up mania (again we both know I'm a layperson but I have experienced mania)
[7/20/23, 09:14:12] Robin Sarabia: The times I’ve had gabapentin, it’s had a pleasantly anti-anxiety effect, but your mileage certainly may vary.
[7/20/23, 09:14:35] Peter Sachs Collopy: It certainly does that for cats!
[7/20/23, 09:14:58] Daniel Frishberg: Gabapentin been recommended to me by a psychiatrist as an antianxiety med
[7/20/23, 09:16:11] Catherine Geard: Gabapentin made me manic. Bouncing off the walls. They gave it to me as a nerve blocker for a pinched nerve in my neck. I had to ween off of it because of how it was affecting me mentally.
[7/20/23, 09:16:34] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have been on it this whole time, I think, and I imagine a significant part of the peace I’m feeling with my new disability is gabapentin or some other med. That too is part of me, at least right now.
[7/20/23, 09:17:03] Peter Sachs Collopy: Interesting! Thank you for confirming that it can do that!
[7/20/23, 09:17:43] Daniel Frishberg: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000199/
[7/20/23, 09:18:35] Daniel Frishberg: But it sounds like you're on a lot of drugs, and also you are having an experience that is far outside of what you're accustomed to.
[7/20/23, 09:19:19] Peter Sachs Collopy: Daniel, do you feel like you’re showing off your work when you link to PubMed since you used to work at NCBI?
[7/20/23, 09:19:19] Daniel Frishberg: Sleep can do wonders
[7/20/23, 09:19:47] Daniel Frishberg: Yes thank me for the pings that your clicks send to Google analytics
[7/20/23, 09:23:13] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yes, I keep thinking of Auden’s phrase “the chemical life.” But honestly most of mine are not exciting at this point.
[7/20/23, 09:42:09] Esteban Kelly: I didn't know you were a fan of Jonah's. We got tight for a few years back when I was in undergrad and I set up house shows for him to play at the Berkeley Student co-ops (which we're basically small venues more than just house shows). We lost touch before social media was a thing.
[7/20/23, 10:24:43] Peter Sachs Collopy: Woah! Well, you’re at least somewhat reunited here!
[7/20/23, 10:29:13] Peter Sachs Collopy: At some point, I predict the three of us will be in the same city at the same time, most likely Philly, and we’ll go to his show.

[7/20/23, 12:14:57] Peter Sachs Collopy: Just an update: I spoke with my doctor about sleep and mood and he thinks I’m doing well and just have some energy within the normal range. I’m gonna take a nap or maybe even two this afternoon, and try to sleep more tonight, but we decided not to add or change any medication.
[7/20/23, 17:54:26] Catherine Geard: That’s good to know. I’ve been thinking all day about something you shared about going back to where the accident occurred to see if it brings back hints of memories. Both my husband and I, respectively, were involved in accidents that caused us to black out while remaining completely conscious, he in a hang gliding accident and me in a car accident. He has video of being aware and conversing with his fellow gliders. This was ten years ago and has no memory of it. I have a very vivid image of being within feet of a tree and then coming to in an ambulance. I’d been talking the whole time. Still no recollection of how I got into that ambulance or what I’d been talking about. All that to say, you may never remember. And it’s ok. Because it’s your brain protecting you from the trauma. I’m so relieved you didn’t incur any lasting mental trauma. Through these conversations and the fact you can type it all out so eloquently, it’s clear you’re pretty darn close to the incredibly bright Peter we know. But patience and Ot/PT is so key for now and years to come. I wish I had taken my PTs instructions more seriously. But I was 19, young and stupid. I’m feeling it now.
[7/20/23, 18:03:34] Peter Sachs Collopy: I do feel very fortunate my brain protected me from this experience. I also feel like whatever I learn at this point won’t be traumatizing in the way remembering it live would have been, because I have some distance. I am glad I’m coming to this experience with the maturity to learn as much from it as I am, and I’m sorry your body went through so much trauma at that (or any) age!

[7/21/23, 06:58:19] Alex White: Peter, do you enjoy cleaning data before analysis or use, or do you find it tedious ?
[7/21/23, 06:58:44] Alex White: I enjoy it more often than I’d admit in some crowds
[7/21/23, 07:04:46] Peter Sachs Collopy: I do enjoy it, and I think there are a bunch of us here who do! I also can get into obsessive loops with it, though, realizing at some point that I really understand the data now and that if I start over I can do things more efficiently. I think it’s the same perfectionism I have with Civ, where I realize I made a mistake 20 steps earlier and just start over. One interesting thing about a traumatic injury: I realize I made a mistake 20 steps earlier, but in this case I don’t know what it was, and I certainly can’t start over, so I have to be at peace with it. It’s easier for me to be at peace with the big stuff than the little stuff.
[7/21/23, 07:05:09] Peter Sachs Collopy: That question might have cut closer to my core than you expected!
[7/21/23, 07:22:09] Peter Sachs Collopy: A personnel triumph: I have never swallowed a pill in my life. My gag reflex comes in, and it just stays in my mouth. All my nurses here have been accommodating, crushing my pills and stirring them into applesauce, and only one of them has teased me for it. But this morning my nurse said that one of my pills really isn’t meant to be crushed, and it was a very small one, so I tried just swallowing it in a spoonful of applesauce—and I did! So from now on, I will say I can only swallow very small pills.
[7/21/23, 09:35:06] Daniel Frishberg: Interesting. As a theoretician, I try to avoid dealing with data to the extent possible.
[7/21/23, 09:36:21] Daniel Frishberg: Well, except when I actually feel like working with data and running experiments. But then arguably I'm not doing that "as a theoretician"

[7/21/23, 09:55:38] ~ Jonah: This one really seems to come in handy at big life moments, whether 'good' or 'bad'. I clearly remember singing it in the hospital with/for a guy called Matt. He was fighting cancer. He's not here anymore. The memory of the tunes together, though. Eternal.
[7/21/23, 09:57:07] ~ Jonah: on the says when i just wanna run away, and the days when a good mood might last a while. always really loved yr company, peter.
[7/21/23, 10:19:53] ~ Shawn Collopy Hardin: Pete, could you please send me your email address and the title of a book that you've been wanting to read?
[7/21/23, 11:03:29] Peter Sachs Collopy: I just had this conversation with a colleague in the context of the exhibition we’re curating. Feynman diagrams aren’t data visualization, at least as used by Feynman himself, I was arguing, because they’re not documenting observations but hypotheses.
[7/21/23, 11:05:58] Chris Boyd: I completely agree. They’re a pictorial representation of some very hairy mathematical theory, but they don’t depict experimentally obtained data.
[7/21/23, 11:19:21] Daniel Frishberg: On the other hand, practically speaking, it's hard to imagine any mathematical theory developing whatsoever in the absence of motivating real-world models
[7/21/23, 11:20:19] Daniel Frishberg: And mathematical proofs are in some sense empirical evidence since they are realized in minds, which as you pointed out earlier, Peter, are part of bodies
[7/21/23, 11:20:39] Daniel Frishberg: And they come with some of the same problems as empirical data, like they can contain mistakes
[7/21/23, 11:32:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: peter@collopy.net.

[7/21/23, 14:32:32] elin slavick: I just read through the whole thread, and am utterly amazed by your continued and generous brilliance Peter. It is very clear that you have many loving fans, and I am one of them! I love the joke about Lenin and Trotsky and healthcare. I am reading Terry Eagleton’s book - Marx was Right - and your joke is just perfect. Healthcare for all yes! I am so happy that you are getting good care and are recovering and sharing it all with us. Thank you.
[7/21/23, 15:18:38] ~ Claire: I just finished reading through the thread history. A few random thoughts:
- can’t believe Fits are no longer made in the US. I loved, loved, loved my Fit. An incredible example of good design; I took a lot of pleasure in being able to haul bigger and bulkier pieces of furniture than my SUV driving friends when I lived in the NJ burbs. I haven’t driven in a few years, but I’m sad another Fit is not in my near future, even if I do manage to get my driver license up to date after letting it expire during the lockdown 
- Thrilled for this graphical language (Feynman diagrams are one example of a graphical language)  exhibit Peter is curating and glad it’s still on. I would love to see more effort spent on the development of graphical languages as representation of abstractions. I see a connection to cognitive abilities in that for many, math is difficult not because of the underlying concepts but because the symbols used to represent those concepts are clunky and take a certain type of cognition to interpret. I’m remembering a conversation with Peter somewhat related to these ideas where he suggested a series called, ‘who gets to know?’ I hope that comes to fruition at some point. 
- I’m finding the discussions of awareness of change, memory, cognitive state, and physical state so interesting. In grad school I was diagnosed with a auditory processing disorder. For me that means I can be completely involved in a conversation, understanding it in the moment, but if the information is all auditory and above a certain complexity my brain doesn’t transfer the info from short term to long term memory. I’ve since learned tricks for forcing the info down alternative memory pathways, but it was a weird experience to become cognizant of this sort of amnesia I have about 20-30 minutes after a complex, technical conversation if I don’t take steps to combat it
- Peter- I love that you put in an information request to the city. You remind me so much of the people I loved back in my civic hacking days
[7/21/23, 16:35:28] ~ Ty: Hard to process, harder to produce words describing my feelings reading about all this
[7/21/23, 16:37:12] elin slavick: I’m not sure how you feel about Teslas Peter, but we bought a used one at Carmax and love it. We usually just get away with plugging it into our house with a regular extension cord because we don’t drive that far and when we do drive far we just take it to a super charging station. I love not having to buy gas.
[7/21/23, 17:15:33] Peter Sachs Collopy: Kara asked me about Zipcar as an option today and I realized I had essentially forgot it existed. My account was locked a couple years ago for having the wrong birthday on it, which was itself a consequence of my driver’s license having my birthday wrong for a while. If I can get it back, there are nine cars three blocks from us, so I might rely on those rather than buying one. Not as fun as a Miata, but much cheaper given how little I expect to drive and the high cost of parking. Somehow I just sort of forgot this was an option after putting off dealing with them about my account for a couple years.
[7/21/23, 17:53:25] Alex White: We tried Gig but they all smelled like cigarettes and we hated it

[7/23/23, 09:59:21] Peter Sachs Collopy: A status update of sorts: Today is my eleventh day in the rehab ward at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. (I wrote this as “ninth” two days ago, but it’s been a busy week and I’m only finishing it now!) The physicians, nurses, patient care associates, physical therapists, and occupational therapists are all incredibly skilled people, and I am learning an enormous amount from them and having days and sometimes nights full of interesting conversations about my own accident, how my muscle control is changing, their own cycling and other sports, and the work of rehabilitation. My body is changing a lot more rapidly than they expect for spinal cord injuries, so they’re having fun with me as a patient. I have also had lots of visitors—Deanna, LA friends, Caltech colleagues, my parents, and my brother—which makes my room an energetic part of the ward.

I spend three hours each weekday, and less time on weekends, in therapy sessions. I’m walking with and without a walker, doing a lot of balance work like lunges and sidestepping, practicing gripping and pegboards and other strength and dexterity stuff with my right hand, showering with a bench, and using a wheelchair a lot. I have a sadomasochistic relationship with some of the PTs where they wear out my legs with a recumbent stair stepper for ten minutes, then make me do balancing exercises. It’s great.

Of four goals I articulated at the beginning of the process—walking, biking, typing, and handling printed books—I’m doing pretty well on three. Walking is a major focus of our work, and my balance gets better every day. Biking we’re saving for later, but the recumbent stair stepper does scratch the itch of feeling my thighs burn.

I figured out independently I could angle my right wrist to project more force through one finger and type. Then on Thursday an occupational therapist learned my brother, who was visiting, is a pianist, and asked if I play too. A little, I said. So we tried playing scales, and I found it very hard to get enough force to trigger the hammers or or hit one key without also hitting an adjacent one, but still did something with the piano.

Then on Friday I woke up with my mouth injuries feeling fully healed, and thus able to eat salad, and with my right fingers moving independently. My mobility literally improved overnight; apparently my brain and nerves needed some calm time to figure things out. That evening, I was telling Andy and Deanna and Lisa and Matthew about this, and decided to try playing scales again—and I basically can now. My fingers are stiff so it’s hard to get an even tempo or loudness, but I can play all the notes.

This translates to typing, but I find myself using my wrists so much that there’s aching in both, so I’m limiting it. My right hand has good mobility, but is also weaker that before the accident, which I mostly only notice trying to squeeze a conditioner bottle, but I think it affects typing stamina too. For now, my best technique for generating text is typing with both thumbs on my phone, which is surprisingly comfortable and fast and which I’m doing now.

And now that I have some movement in my fingers, handling books feels slightly clumsy but basically fine. I haven’t done it much yet because I have been in this extroverted mode where I spend most of my free time talking and texting with all of you. And the remainder has mostly been catching up on blogs—6185 posts left—and watching I Think You Should Leave on the principle that I should spend hospital time alone watching TV that Deanna would hate.

How are you all doing? ‎<This message was edited>

[7/23/23, 10:53:24] Anne Sullivan: Thank you for sharing this update, and for sharing the archive of this text thread! I really appreciated scrolling back through your earlier updates and through the posts from everyone in this text community. It does not surprise me that you continue to build community even while healing 💖 It is so heartening to hear that you’re receiving such great care and making progress toward your goals. 

To answer your question, I’m doing ok! My sister is in town visiting from Salem, MA, for three weeks. We’ve been doing some crafting - a beaded jewelry class and a pottery class - and exploring old haunts.
[7/23/23, 11:01:44] Dave Collopy: Your status update is so comprehensive, Peter, that I am simply blown away. The world you’ve come to know since the crash is engaging, my dear nephew, as is your acceptance of managing to live life on life’s terms. The combination of the two blows me away even more.
[7/23/23, 13:14:02] ~ Tom Nickel: Hi Peter, I joined a few days back and have enjoyed the discussion.  Your 100% upbeat attitude is really conducive to health and recovery and I wish more people could experience how you are approaching things mentally and emotionally.  But also please don't hesitate to express the darker sides when they emerge.

I have hosted an event in VR the past 3 1/2 years called Saying Goodbye, where people talk about what they have lost in front of caring strangers or acquaintances.  It helps.  We associate grieving with sadness but it doesn't have to be.  There is a behavioral, ritual, component as well that you may wish to consider.

If you are interested in exploring any Human VR platforms, where the emphasis is on interaction rather than simply game playing, I'd love to introduce you. 

Glad to be here.

[7/23/23, 14:44:15] elin slavick: Chiming in here like everyone else that your update blows my mind with Joy and Hope! I am so glad you are recovering so speedily and are writing about it so brilliantly and sharing it with us all. I really hope to come visit you next week after our son leaves. I did call and leave a message. I hope you got it! I’m thinking of you a lot and continue to send all positive energy your way. I think this experience of yours is going to become a book. Not Sure if you follow Marvin heiferman on Instagram, but his memories and posts about losing Maurice berger, his partner, is becoming a book of texts and images. I can imagine you doing something like that as well. Of course, it would be extremely different, but I think it would be amazing. Sending all love!

[7/24/23, 04:25:19] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you, Tom! I’ve been thinking about your invitation to grieve without sadness (or with it), and I think it is one I may take up later, but uncertainty is taking the place of grief right now. I don’t know if I’ll ride a conventional bike again, for example, so I’m not ready to grieve that ability until I know it’s not coming back. If I do know that at some point—and I think it might be if I don’t develop that level of balance over the next year, because spinal cord injuries have a period of about a year of change before they stabilize—then ritual grief sounds appealing. And also, at that point I’ll buy a tricycle.
[7/24/23, 05:31:02] ~ Kewing: Hi, Pete. I’m enjoying reading everyone’s posts here. I wrote you a long-ish email I didn’t think would necessarily be of general interest here. Let me know if you have access to that.   Kathy
[7/24/23, 06:05:36] Peter Sachs Collopy: Hi Kathy! Thank you for being here with me! I really appreciated and enjoyed your email/letter, and I’m sorry I haven’t written back yet. One brief thought I had is that the origins of military origins of rehabilitative medicine might contribute to its relatively humane approach to patients, taking their/our experiences more seriously than other branches of medicine, because soldiers in wartime might be harder to dehumanize than other classes of patients. I will do some digging for other tellings of this history! I was also impressed with your father’s self-respect, which I do imagine must have been more difficult in an era of greater public disrespect for those with disabilities. Some US cities still had “ugly laws,” literally criminalizing the presence of people with visible disabilities in public, until Chicago was the last to repeal its in 1974. (They were intended to be used against beggars specifically, but worded at least to criminalize those with wealth as well, although of course not enforced against them.) I do think many here would be interested if you wanted to share your letter here, but that’s entirely up to you of course. (I’ve been doing a lot of writing to one or a few people and then sharing it more publicly here, so there is precedent if you decide to.) ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/23, 06:07:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: It occurs to me now that one product of this one year healing time is that the anniversary of my accident—July 6, 2024—is going to be an exceptionally significant date for me, and certainly one worth ritualizing. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/23, 06:13:01] Mog Youngberg: Could be a good time to have a big house party, plus or minus.
[7/24/23, 06:14:17] Peter Sachs Collopy: It could! Thank you for connecting this with that idea from earlier! And I think a time to do some of whatever kind of cycling I can, whether on two wheels or three.
[7/24/23, 06:23:13] Peter Sachs Collopy: I know a cyclist here in LA, Damian Kevitt, who was hit and dragged by a car. He now has a prosthetic leg. He has a charismatic story about vowing to “finish the ride” on which he was hit, and he did, then founded a road safety nonprofit. As a fundraiser, they host an annual organized and supported group ride called “Finish the Ride,” which I rode this year six weeks ago. I don’t have Damien’s attitude of my injury or disability as something to triumph over, but I think doing whatever ride I can with friends a year after my accident would be meaningful.

With an emphasis on doing it with friends; the friendship I share with all of you is a huge part of this process for me, as it is a huge and important part of my life. One thing I really appreciate about this situation is that it is catalyzing the revival of some friendships and intensification of others. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/24/23, 15:12:55] Kara Whatley: Related to this, maybe? 7/6 this year was the first day of Bein Hametzarim, which I know nothing about other than what I just googled. But maybe there’s something there for the ritual?
[7/24/23, 16:00:04] ~ L. Lee Butler: i think it would depend on how much you are feeling the mourning part of dealing with sudden injury and new disability. the three weeks (which ends this wednesday/thursday with tisha b’av) doesn’t have a ton of ritual framework i’m aware of other than adopting the trappings of personal mourning to commemorate genocide. i personally find the book of eicha (lamentations) and the kinot (liturgical poems) for this time period better at helping me connect to unimaginable horror, rather than access my own experiences of trauma or mourning.
[7/24/23, 17:51:33] ~ Michael E. Alexander: I have an almost new walker - top of the line model with brakes, a small storage space under a seat, converts to a wheel chair very easily and collapses for easy transport. I been happy to lend it for as long as you need. It’s sitting in my garage since my recovery from cancer surgery last year.
[7/24/23, 18:22:34] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you! I will let you know! I might need to stick with a standard compact one for now because I can only lift five pounds for the next six weeks still as my surgery heals. And I like how the compact ones fold flat. But if the built-in seat seems like it would be useful, I will ask to borrow it. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/24/23, 20:34:46] ~ Tom Nickel: Peter - You're right to think about preparing for the anniversary, because it will enable you to channel what comes up in a healthy direction instead of being surprised and knocked for a loop by it as people often are.

But that's a year from now. You wrote of deferring grieving a bit because of the level of uncertainty.  I think we can do both.  Some experts say we're 'hardwired to dislike uncertainty,' which is obviously bs since we're not hardwired to do anything.  You are embracing uncertainty and seeing possible opportunities no matter how things turn out to be in any given moment.  Probably your life will have more uncertainty going forward.  

I don't think grieving is about uncertainty and what the future may hold.  I think it's about acknowledging what you thought things were going to be like for you in July, 2023 and saying goodbye to that.  There may be more to say goodbye to later but this little bit might be good practice.
[7/24/23, 20:55:16] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you for that sense of concreteness to grief! I was going to take a class two weeks ago and see lots of friends in Connecticut and Philadelphia last week. I am sad about missing those things. And I was going to visit Cleveland in late August and see more friends and see one old friend music direct my favorite musical, Fun Home, and be with my mom on her birthday, but I don’t think I will want to, or should, fly so soon, while still recovering from surgery. So that travel is what I am already grieving, I suppose.
[7/24/23, 21:12:00] Peter Sachs Collopy: And I miss bicycling, for however long I need to take away from it. And living with Deanna rather than just having her visit, for as long as I’m in the hospital. And our cat Babka, very much, because that is such a total and unexpected separation. But I’ll be home in ten days at the latest. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/23, 21:14:41] Peter Sachs Collopy: I also so much appreciate how this injury has strengthened or revived many of my friendships, so my grief at missing travel to see friends is close to joy at seeing and speaking with friends, sometimes the same people. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/23, 21:19:42] ~ Tom Nickel: Loss is funny that way -- it's still loss, but it can also lead to unexpected benefits.  I also note that you writing these losses, and gains, publicly in front of caring people has more healing power than just thinking it.
[7/25/23, 07:09:39] Peter Sachs Collopy: I think I’ve felt instinctively that communicating about every aspect of this experience is important to my healing. I’ve said this at least a dozen times to people, but haven’t written it here: the single hardest part of this process was the difficulty in communicating in the three or four days following surgery. I was intubated, which made me extremely hoarse and made talking painful. And I had a lot of nerve pain in my hands, which made texting painful. I felt like I was having some of the most intense emotions and experiences of my life, and they were physically bottled up inside of me. So once I became able to talk with only mild pain, I started talking a lot, to Deanna, to a few other visitors, to nurses, and to friends on speaker phone. And as my hand pain subsided, I started writing a lot, as you all have seen here. It has been the most extraverted period of my life. I have watched and read rather little, and my podcast consumption is much lower than usual, because I have spent most of my free time communicating. Yesterday evening I finally felt out of social energy, but even then I spent many hours fiddling with Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon, following more people and migrating my networks between the services, which isn’t not social.
[7/25/23, 07:11:58] Charlie Simon: Long live decentralized social. Which like much of the Internet, is only peripherally social.
[7/25/23, 07:12:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: One of my little aphorisms is “all media are social.”
[7/25/23, 07:13:20] Peter Sachs Collopy: The only exceptions are those created for oneself, like to-do lists and diaries, and even then I would entertain arguments.
[7/25/23, 07:15:21] Lisa Cooper Vest: Oh I have definitely read diaries in my research that were social, written with the intention to share and be read later! So I guess solitary with delayed social intentions?
[7/25/23, 07:15:46] Charlie Simon: Eh… if it’s in the public eye it’s media and if your aphorism is correct it’s social. I guess I’d draw the line at lists on locked accounts but seems like you should just use Evernote
[7/25/23, 07:15:53] Mog Youngberg: I definitely think these are social.
[7/25/23, 07:17:17] Peter Sachs Collopy: Certainly! Not all diaries are not social, but the idea of a diary might contain the potential for media which are unshared.
[7/25/23, 07:19:02] Peter Sachs Collopy: I appreciate you all doing media theory with me this morning.
[7/25/23, 07:19:25] Charlie Simon: Switching gears. Many of us only share this level of personal journey with therapists, even though we know the act of sharing is healing. I think for me it’s fear of being judged and judging myself. I’m glad you’re sharing and healing with us and we’re here to hear it. Also a little humanizing to read that even you have a social battery!
[7/25/23, 07:20:47] elin slavick: I remember when I almost died from 15 killer Asian hornet stings on an island off the coast of Hiroshima years ago and was intubated and woke up in the hospital and the most urgent thing I felt was the need to communicate with everyone about what happened. Perhaps it’s the near death experience Combined with not knowing exactly what happened upon waking - or just our human need to share but I relate. I think in some ways we are all intro/extroverted. I like the distinction between solitude and loneliness. It seems to me that these communications avoid loneliness, even though some of them might be done in a solitary mode. Regardless, I love reading everything you write about this experience Peter and I find your sharing of it very generous and therapeutic, even for me. So thank you. And thank you to everyone else for writing brilliant Things as well! Many of you are strangers to me, but we are now connected Thanks to Peter. Quite social!
[7/25/23, 07:24:17] Peter Sachs Collopy: Usually my social battery is sort of medium sized. And usually I mostly work with people with larger ones and mostly socialize with people with smaller ones, so it feels big or small depending on the company.

I think I feel more courage about sharing than usual because I think people are less likely to be mean to someone who is recovering from a traumatic injury. So far that has been true. But also, that’s the reason this isn’t an actually public conversation, as lax as my security about the exported transcript is. I’m not saying all of this on Twitter, although I don’t think there’s anything I’m embarrassed of.
[7/25/23, 07:27:29] Peter Sachs Collopy: Speaking of which, many of you are in the transcript too. If you would like me to secure it better, please let me know. It’s just sitting on my web server, but only people here know the URL. I could add a password.
[7/25/23, 07:29:35] Charlie Simon: Consider adding robots.txt to stop it from being indexed
[7/25/23, 07:32:46] Peter Sachs Collopy: Good call.
[7/25/23, 07:33:30] Peter Sachs Collopy: I of course regularly disrespect robots.txt as an archivist, but only on Caltech’s own websites.
[7/25/23, 07:35:47] Peter Sachs Collopy: (I don’t think anyone has the institution itself preserving a copy in mind as the use case when they set a rule against crawlers.)
[7/25/23, 07:38:08] Mog Youngberg: I agree with you
[7/25/23, 07:38:23] Mog Youngberg: Plus you’re probably not going to pull your own site down with traffic
[7/25/23, 07:39:07] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yeah, Archive-It seems pretty slow and steady.
[7/25/23, 08:07:49] Peter Sachs Collopy: New topic: I don’t think I can do it justice now, but it feels impossible to overstate how much the podcast Death Panel has influenced my thinking about disability, health, and medicine, and thus my approach to healing from this injury. I know many people admire or respect my approach, so I imagine that might give some real weight to this podcast recommendation. I don’t have a specific episode to recommend; rather, I recommend skimming the list and picking an episode with a topic or guest of particular interest to you or relevance to your own experiences. They’re consistently good enough that I think I can recommend them all. (And some Penn HSS folks may remember the prococious undergrad Phil Rocco ’09, now a professor of political science who is sort of the poli sci equivalent of a healthcare economist. He is one of the team behind the podcast.)
[7/25/23, 08:17:57] Peter Sachs Collopy: I guess there’s an irony to this: their analysis of the US healthcare system is not at all positive, and my experience of it has been. There are exceptions to patterns, but understanding the pattern can still help with understanding the exception. In all aspects of this situation except the accident itself happening and it injuring my spinal cord, I have been ludicrously fortunate, and I think Death Panel presents a vision of how that good fortune could be more widely distributed and why it isn’t. And there are still unnecessary indignities to patient life which I don’t really complain about because the staff here are tremendously caring towards me in most ways, but which make more sense with a broader analysis of the healthcare system.
[7/25/23, 08:21:34] Peter Sachs Collopy: The podcast also helped me understand and grieve the death of a friend in November, so I feel like it’s been life-changing, honestly. How’s that for a blurb?
[7/25/23, 08:27:16] ~ Tom Nickel: In addition to hosting a bereavement event in VR called Saying Goodbye, I also host an event called Death Q&A, which began in April, 2020 when death was much more high profile than usual and I figured people might like a place to talk about their death anxieties.  The event is still going strong.  

I have come to see every ending at every scale as a form of death, and every transition as a Bardo state as described in the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.  This is a quantized view of our lives, as opposed to the continuous wave idea we mostly cling to.  A lot died with your accident, Peter, like your plans to travel this summer, and a lot is still uncertain.  To me, looking at life this way is a form of exposure therapy, getting used to the idea of impermanence.
[7/25/23, 11:21:52] Catherine Geard: Babka!!!
[7/25/23, 12:09:36] Peter Sachs Collopy: So you know how I said I have very good fortune in this process? I just had more of it! I emailed our apartment building management office to ask whether they would prefer for their staff to install safety bars in the shower or for us to hire a contractor ourselves. The law says they have to let us do it, but they don’t have to help us. We were worried they might push back, though, or want to do it themselves but charge us a lot. Instead I just got this email back: “I'm sorry to hear about your injury.  I will order the bars and have them installed by tomorrow.  Will you be home or can maintenance enter?” I kind of feel like I’m just charmed!
[7/25/23, 12:10:01] Chris Boyd: That’s wonderful!
[7/25/23, 13:44:50] elin slavick: Peter, you are not just charmed, but you are also charming 💙

[7/25/23, 17:04:26] ~ Hillary: Hi Peter, Hillary here chiming in to say you and your wonderful, supportive community are amazing. Just reading the log of this chat inspires awe and hope. Btw I drive a Nissan Leaf which I really like. Also, I have been in some scary bike accidents and know that we are so vulnerable while whizzing at delightful speeds. The thrill of biking is in part that we are superhuman on those contraptions (or prosthetics). Have you read Sara Hendren’s work on ableism? I love her book “What Can a Body Do?”, her expansive ideas about what  a prosthetic is and what are mainstream expectations for a “normal” body.
‎[7/25/23, 17:47:58] Dave Collopy: ‎image omitted
[7/25/23, 18:16:00] Peter Sachs Collopy: I have not, but thank you for the recommendation! I will! One thing I have picked up from disability studies more generally is thinking about prostheses in all sorts of contexts, so I’ve written about tape decks, and especially Nam June Paik’s Random Access, as prostheses that allow sighted or hearing people to also temporarily develop a sense for magnetism, which unaided humans only have very weakly if at all. (And some of the “very weakly” position is coming from Caltech, from Joe Kirshwink.) Bikes have a particular symbolic role in the history of prosthesis; I have been thinking for maybe 12 years about writing an article on Apple’s advertising rhetoric of “a bicycle for the mind,” framing their computers as tools for accelerating thought as efficient as bicycles.

[7/25/23, 23:03:54] Allegra Giovine: Peter, do you know who Andrew Leland is? 
https://www.andrewleland.org/
I don't know him personally but have seen his name before, and recently heard very good things about his just published book, the Country of the Blind: 
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/635964/the-country-of-the-blind-by-andrew-leland/
definitely intersects with ideas on this thread and part of your experience right now.
also I don't know how I didn't know you have a cat named Babka!  wonderful.
[7/25/23, 23:31:27] Garth Donald: This has been incredible to read, thank you for sharing all of this, Peter.   This seems to be an incredibly healthy approach that you have found. 

I've noticed 2 adaptive technologies mentioned that I believe might be very helpful to you.   A good VR system would let you have unique experiences while working on large muscle rehabilitation.   And when the time comes,  a battery- assisted tricycle would get you up and rolling the fastest.   Let us know if you want to pursue either of these, you have a strong community that is committed to helping you find fulfilling activities again.
[7/26/23, 05:55:30] ~ Kewing: You’ve already read this in an email, Pete, but I decided to share it. 
                                                                                                           When your mom told me, when I asked her where to send you a card, that the department you’re in is called Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, it sparked my thinking about my dad’s experience, and I decided the history might be interesting to you.

In the early 50s, my dad worked for the Canton newspaper. When he was diagnosed with a spinal abscess, the company took care of all of his medical expenses (paternalistic but very helpful) and sent him three times, I think, to what was then called the Institute of Medical and Physical Rehabilitation (IPMR), a part of New York University Medical School. After several surgeries, he lost the use of his legs but learned life skills at IPMR. 

In 1984, the name was changed to the Rusk Institute of Medical Rehabilitation.
That’s honoring Howard A. Rusk, who established IPMR at NYU in 1950 and who’s considered the founder of rehabilitation medicine. He had served in the Air Force during the war and became interested in rehabilitation when working with injured airmen. If you look him up on Wikipedia, you’ll see a photo of him with Roy Campanella, the Dodgers catcher who was injured in a car accident in 1958. My dad was at the Institute at the same time, and he knew Dr. Rusk as well.

There’s also a YouTube video of an old interview with Dr. Rusk about visiting Korea more than once and trying to help Koreans disabled during the war. He was much honored and quite a pioneer. His memoir is called A World to Care For.

All these developments were precursors to the disability movement, I think. My dad used to say that handicapped people (the term we used at the time) mostly stayed in their houses. Very few restaurants or public facilities were accessible. When we on rare occasions went to restaurants as a family, we were pretty conspicuous: you just didn’t see wheelchairs in public places. Dr. Rusk’s efforts attempted to counter this. He believed every person with a disability would benefit from therapy (and he included psychological therapy), and most could probably work again.

I wonder if anyone on your medical team has heard of him. I wouldn’t be surprised either way.

My dad also wrote some things about his stays at the Institute and the rehabilitation he underwent there, which I can send if you want. He learned to pretty much take care of himself, which in earlier eras I don’t think would have been possible. He also started a social club for people with disabilities. 

When I was telling your mom some of this, she thought you would be interested, and I thought so, too. You’re reminding me of my dad in another way as well: your attitude toward your recovery and what’s happened. A friend wrote to my dad once that he’d never seen my dad’s “chin droop.” Of course, your chin might droop now and then, but I can echo what everyone’s saying on this site, that you’re inspiring.
[7/26/23, 06:06:51] Peter Sachs Collopy: I didn’t, but I just read one of his magazine articles, which was good!
[7/26/23, 07:40:24] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you, Garth! I’m not really excited about VR generally, but I’ll think about it. I don’t think I could use it comfortably or safely right now, at least standing, because moving while standing is already pretty high cognitive load with real world visual cues, and would be harder with virtual ones.

I do think I’m going to join the Planet Fitness down the block from our apartment, because exercise machines seem like the safest context for exercise right now; as a martial artist and then a cyclist, I have never really done gym exercise and have always preferred using body weight and avoiding stationary machines, but I have been loving the recumbent stairstepper they put me on here and want to have access to one regularly at home too.

I have been reading about tricycles, and I’m excited about the state of recumbent ones, some of which are about 35 pounds and look fast. The one thing that always makes me anxious about recumbent bikes and trikes is how low they are, which is a scary thing in traffic. Conventionally people put flags on them, but I don’t really feel like that’s enough, so I think if I got one I might build a colorful structure of some sort on top to give it some presence at eye level for drivers.

Whether I would want a tricycle to be electric depends on how my strength and stamina improve, I think. My stairstepping feels way better than walking or anything else, because there’s no proprioception involved, so I think I might also have way more stamina peddling than walking at this point. I have an ebike and like it, but mostly for speed (a theme here, and presumably why I got hurt, although I was just riding a regular bike downhill) and getting less sweaty on the way to work, not for stamina—pre-accident, I could last longer than it can.

Normal upright tricycles might also be an option, but my sense is they’re not as fast, and that’s also a safely issue in traffic, where I can sometimes keep up with cars.

Finally, I don’t know how quickly my balance will keep improving. I would not be shocked if I could get on a bike again soon enough to regret buying a tricycle. I also wouldn’t be shocked if I never can. It’s really uncertain. In any case, I have six more weeks with a cervical collar on, so that means no tricycles because I can’t turn my head, but I can do stationary bike riding and just go for some walks for outdoor exercise.
[7/26/23, 19:15:57] Peter Sachs Collopy: We have sort of had my reply first here and then Kathy’s letter, so I’m going to post my reply again for reading *after* the letter:

Hi Kathy! Thank you for being here with me! I really appreciated and enjoyed your email/letter, and I’m sorry I haven’t written back yet. One brief thought I had is that the origins of military origins of rehabilitative medicine might contribute to its relatively humane approach to patients, taking their/our experiences more seriously than other branches of medicine, because soldiers in wartime might be harder to dehumanize than other classes of patients. I will do some digging for other tellings of this history! I was also impressed with your father’s self-respect, which I do imagine must have been more difficult in an era of greater public disrespect for those with disabilities. Some US cities still had “ugly laws,” literally criminalizing the presence of people with visible disabilities in public, until Chicago was the last to repeal its in 1974. (They were intended to be used against beggars specifically, but worded at least to criminalize those with wealth as well, although of course not enforced against them.)
[7/26/23, 20:32:56] Catherine Geard: That is fascinating. And terrifying that the last law wasn’t repealed till two years after I was born!!
[7/26/23, 20:36:28] Peter Sachs Collopy: Yep! It really conveys how recent and incomplete public acceptance of people with disabilities is. (There is a book on this entitled The Ugly Laws, and the author and I both presented at a Huntington conference on eugenics, disability, and race in the fall, but I haven’t read it yet so I just bought a copy.)
[7/26/23, 20:39:21] Catherine Geard: I mean it’s only been 33 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.
[7/26/23, 20:39:31] Catherine Geard: US is slow to change.
[7/26/23, 23:43:05] ~ Claire: As an example of how far we have to go, Caltech got its first trained disability person less than 3 years ago in late 2020. We’re barely recognizing the ADA exists and most focus is on making sure students (who have muddled through a byzantine healthcare system to prove they really do have a disability) aren’t getting ‘unfair advantage.’ I’m regularly in conversations where it’s implied that a student is faking their disability to get ahead or is just ‘entitled and thinks they’re special’ despite mountains of evidence to the contrary. It’s… infuriating
[7/27/23, 06:24:40] Peter Sachs Collopy: That is infuriating! The library has taken a leading role in improving accessibility within Caltech, and I think it’s fair to say that three of my fellow archivists took a leading role within the library, but that has all only happened in the last few years also. I do feel more comfortable with the idea of coming to work with a walker, for example, in the library than I think I would in other departments. Institutions structured by belief in meritocracy—a word originally coined by a British sociologist and Labour politician, Michael Young, who thought the idea was absurd, because of course people have unjust advantages and disadvantages, particularly in education (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment)—are really vulnerable to prejudice against anyone weak or perceived as weak in any way, intellectually, physically, and emotionally. I think Caltech has some deeper work to do rejecting the idea that its faculty and students are better that everyone else—better at specific skills, sure, but that’s not the same. But more than that, the more I think about it the more skeptical I am about the ethics of selective colleges at all, even though I’ve spent my entire adult life in them. I think perhaps open admissions, along with free tuition of course, may be the best or even only path to educational equity. This doesn’t mean I’m gonna stop working for selective institutions, because they’re the places that want to hire me. But I do have some reservations about the idea that they’re morallly good.
[7/27/23, 06:28:43] Naomi Socher-Lerner: Careful, now. You keep talking like that and you'll end up in public libraries 😜

We'd be lucky to have you
[7/27/23, 06:50:43] Peter Sachs Collopy: All this said, the Caltech Leave Unit has been fantastic at supporting me and Deanna through the process of taking some time off work. And I feel confident my job will still be there for me when I’m ready to return, which FMLA only requires for 12 weeks—which might be long enough, but who knows. (My doctor’s letter to Caltech says my absence will be at least three months, and possibly up to a year.)
[7/27/23, 06:52:21] Peter Sachs Collopy: Honestly, I think I would love it, but there are only so many special collections jobs in public libraries and maybe none specializing in history of science? But I could imagine applying for a more general special collections role.
[7/27/23, 07:17:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: I woke up this morning thinking about the Adrienne Rich poem “Power,” which Deanna made the epigram to her dissertation. https://allpoetry.com/poem/11641436-Power-by-Adrienne-Rich

It ends, regarding Marie Curie:

She died a famous woman denying
her wounds
denying
her wounds came from the same source as her power.

I was thinking about it because I’ve been feeling like I have a power that comes from the same source as my wounds, a greater level of emotional awareness and clarity, an ability to communicate it, a comfort with uncertainty. I can’t recommend spinal cord injury, but the consequences have not all been negative.
[7/27/23, 08:47:25] ~ Claire: I’ve had pretty positive recent experiences with the disability and leave unit too. Not to be too cynical, but guessing what happened with the glass blower and his courageous lawsuit/ willingness to go public got Caltech to clean up things at the staff/ faculty level. Unfortunately students don’t have access to DLAU :( I will say the most egregious stuff in student affairs seems to have been cleaned up. It did take me going all the way to the provost a year or so ago. It was probably the most stressful period of my professional career, but I believe we are now at least in compliance with a 1990’s interpretation of the ADA for what it’s worth. 

There’s a lot of evidence that for established Institutions, culture comes from structure, and beliefs are changed by changing behaviors rather than the other way around. Hopefully the student version of DLAU will eventually get resourced to a level sufficient to enforce better practices
[7/27/23, 14:13:39] ~ Kewing: This Mary Oliver poem served as the epigram for my book Missing, about my mother:

Someone I loved once gave me 

A box full of darkness. 

It took me years to understand 

That this, too, was a gift.

[7/30/23, 17:49:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: Hello! It has been a quiet weekend here, in part because hospital sleep deprivation finally caught up with me yesterday and I was intensely exhausted. That was a trigger to try Ambien for the first time in my life, and it really helped me sleep last night, more deeply, with fewer interruptions, and longer than I have been for the last week or so. And then I took two one-hour naps today, so now I'm pretty much feeling like new. I hope you're feeling good too. How are you all?
[7/30/23, 17:51:26] Mog Youngberg: I am teaching for the first time at a folk dance camp I have a long and deep relationship with. I’m absolutely exhausted. The setting is idyllic, and I’m with people I love, but I can’t shake imposter feelings.
[7/30/23, 17:52:56] Peter Sachs Collopy: I don't really know you as a dancer, but I know how long and how seriously you have worked on these skills, so I have real confidence that your expertise and your passion come through in your teaching in a way that your students are appreciating.
[7/30/23, 17:54:12] Mog Youngberg: Thank you, Peter. That means a lot. I have a lot of building blocks of teaching, and I’m connecting them on the fly, which is sort of exhilarating and also terrifying at the same time.
[7/30/23, 17:54:36] Mog Youngberg: Trying to state the non-obvious for everyone is not actually possible, is it?
[7/30/23, 17:57:28] Peter Sachs Collopy: In my own experience, a lot of the best teaching is improvised. I don't think there's much correlation between preparation and success beyond a certain floor of knowledge. It's so contingent though, I think sometimes preparation can increase consistency but it certainly can't increase the maximum achievable, which might even be greater with the fluidity and flexibility of responding to students and changing the lesson as it goes, which in turn is easier without too much investment in a strict curriculum.
[7/30/23, 17:59:58] Mog Youngberg: Apparently this is exactly what I needed to hear. So, thank you.
[7/30/23, 18:02:52] Peter Sachs Collopy: Teaching body movement in particular, which I haven't done in a long time but I used to with Tae Kwon Do, works at such different paces for different people depending on their body awareness and their previous experience and therefore how capable they are of converting example and instruction into movement. One thing I am learning from physical and occupational therapy is that I'm apparently really good at this, which I credit to that Tae Kwon Do experience, and also suggests that many people have a really hard time with it and need much more time and patience. So part of teaching, whether for my therapists or for us, is providing that time and patience. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 18:05:48] Peter Sachs Collopy: That's hard and limited in a group setting though.
[7/30/23, 18:17:34] Peter Sachs Collopy: I've been experiencing more nerve pain in my hands today than I usually do during the day. In general, it increases at night, and has been one of the things waking me up. A few of the nurses and therapists I've talked to have suggested that the pain increases when I don't use my hands, and so of course that happens with sleep, but it also happens when I have less therapy on the weekends and particularly this weekend because of exhaustion and not doing much hand exercise on my own. So I'm learning how to use Apple's dictation system. At first, I couldn't figure out how to make it delete. It turns out that the basic dictation that's on all the time can't. But there is a much more sophisticated voice control system that includes not only deletion but all sorts of text editing tools and system navigation tools, so I've been learning that. If you ever have any trouble using an iPhone or Mac with your hands, I really recommend playing around with it as well; it's kind of fun to verbally tell a machine what to do so completely. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dictation-software/
[7/30/23, 18:19:58] Peter Sachs Collopy: I've never been excited about the supposed flexibility and natural language interpretation of Siri or Amazon and Google's competitors to it, and those competitors, which I understand work much better than Siri, are built into surveillance economies that I can't imagine accommodating enough to make them useful to me. But a voice command system that has precise commands feels really great and worth learning. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 18:42:03] Daniel Frishberg: Surgery itself can also really tire out the body for a little while. Rest is good!
[7/30/23, 18:43:39] Beverly Socher-Lerner: WELL SAID. I teach teachers for a living, and this reasonates. I do teach structures, but once folks REALLY know them, I expect them to modify significantly and know when to throw them out!
[7/30/23, 18:47:57] Chris Boyd: In my experience, past that floor of subject matter knowledge, additional knowledge *is* important, but it’s knowledge of common pitfalls students encounter. I find that some mistakes and misconceptions are sufficiently common that the more I teach, the more prepared I am to anticipate these difficulties on the students’ part.
[7/30/23, 18:49:31] Peter Sachs Collopy: There's a real tension between rest and physical therapy after this surgery, and mostly they're doing a great job navigating it, but four weeks of sleeping in a hospital is the Achilles’ heel of the system for me. That said, Ambien might be the solution. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 18:51:31] Peter Sachs Collopy: We have so many teachers of so many different subjects here, I'm glad we're having some conversation about it.
[7/30/23, 19:07:18] ~ Yedida: You are lucky to be good at it.  I am a person who requires much patience :)
[7/30/23, 19:12:28] Peter Sachs Collopy: I looked through the list of people here and listed some things I know we have taught. And these are just the ones we've taught formally; I know as parents and community members many have taught lots of other things, and I'm sure even formally I'm missing some and have some recency bias. Anthropology, co-ops, history of science, technology, and medicine (apologies for not taking over the whole list with semicolons), computer science, math, linguistics, music, musical theater, literature, ecology and evolutionary biology (especially marine and avian), Judaism, yoga, birth, media studies, chemistry, science and technology studies, art, information systems, art history, visual culture, political science, library resources, programming, musicology, gardening, medicine, law, environmental history, philosophy, dance, martial arts, grief, dying, teaching. Several of these have multiple teachers here who don't know each other, so if you're curious and would like me to play (probably Platonic) matchmaker, please ask, maybe through a message outside of the group. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 19:13:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: And those here who don't teach formally are also teachers, we're all teachers; I'm not trying to elevate anyone, just to show how much experience there is here.
[7/30/23, 19:16:42] Becca Derry: Hi all. I've mostly been here listening and learning, but I did want to chime in with a thought about teaching (I'm a high school English teacher). In my experience, preparation and flexibility are not particularly correlated: it's possible to prepare a lot and still be flexible and fluid, responding and changing the instruction based on the students' responses, and conversely, not preparing as much does not necessarily make people better at responding fluidly to students' needs. Different axes, perhaps.
[7/30/23, 19:27:51] Peter Sachs Collopy: I wonder if it's easier to prepare a lot and also be flexible if you have a lot of experience and spend a lot of time teaching. I teach more occasionally—although I suppose occasionally since my early teens—and I feel like I have experienced overpreparing, sticking too much to my plan, whereas perhaps if I taught every day I would feel more comfortable departing. When I prepare a little less I improvise more as a result and feel more flexible—but I also have had moments of stalling and not being sure what to do. I guess I'm saying I always find it hard, and satisfying for it when it goes well and I'm sure I still would if I did it every day, but I suspect in different ways. More than two axes, and interacting with each other, maybe? ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 19:36:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: But also, perhaps overpreparing is a concept that got stuck in my head and through which I interpret my experiences even if they really don't fit. It's hard to know, except maybe by observing myself in the future with particular attention to this. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 19:45:39] ~ Melissa Lo: I’ve also found that when I go into a classroom - or really any meeting - with the attitude that the people I’m with will teach me things, it makes things much more interesting for me! (Also hugely helpful with parenting!)
[7/31/23, 03:47:53] Laine Nooney: Interested to know more about you voice recognition experience! I've been using VR, esp for long form document production, almost 10 years now. Not an Apple user so stuck with Dragon by Nuance, which is a not very good product but has a near total monopoly in this software space!
[7/31/23, 10:05:24] elin slavick: After teaching art at the university level for 27 years, I realize that something I often said to my students, and to people who asked me about teaching, was that I learned as much from them as I taught them. Their questions and observations about the required reading (which I always had to re-read and that kept me on my theoretical toes) and their  “solutions” to the assignments were often extraordinary and ibttoduced me to so many different processes, strategies, methodologies, materials and concepts!
[7/31/23, 10:09:39] Peter Sachs Collopy: My first day of voice recognition experience has been mixed. It just heard mixed as next, for example, and I had to tell it to replace it twice. And it keeps hearing comma as call mom, which is rude under any circumstances, but in this case because I am every day right now. So it's nice to not use my hands, but I feel like I'm spending a lot of time correcting the transcription. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/31/23, 10:10:11] elin slavick: I was always hyper prepared as a professor, but I’m a pretty hyper person about everything. That said, I often put away the syllabus and changed everything for the semester, and stayed pretty flexible to rearrange things according to need and the energy of the classroom. Being prepared at the start set a good example to the students to be prepared and to know what to expect in the class, but I think seeing some experimentation going on and spontaneous action was a surprise for them and a good one.
[7/31/23, 11:05:06] elin slavick: I hope you are feeling rested and keep resting ❤️
[7/31/23, 11:10:36] elin slavick: Since you asked how we were all doing, I have a feeling you really want to know, I will tell you that I have been sick for about a week. I started seeing floaters in my eyes and then, for the last five nights I have been seeing bright white lightning flashes on the periphery of my left eye. I went to see my eye doctor and she dilated my eyes and I do not have a detached retina, but I am still seeing lightning flashes at night so I will see an ophthalmologist, but not until September (earliest appt). I’m going to go to the doctor today to see what else I can find out because I have been sick for almost a week now. 

Nothing compared to what you’re going through and can’t help the Sinead O’Connor pun, nothing compares to you! Her leaving this world has hit me pretty hard. 

I did manage to go see the crazy pageant of the masters in Laguna Beach the other night and a screening of Bruce Connor’s CrossRoads last night at the hammer with an incredible PowerPoint by Ross Lipman. Lipman introduces the film with some historical context, and then after the film closes it out with some more, an animated PowerPoint with live narration. He is the one who helped restore Connors original CrossRoads film about the American nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll, the first two after the Trinity test. Overall, there were 23 nuclear tests at bikini. He didn’t want people to forget the horrors of the nuclear test. I learned that he had moved to Mexico in the 60s to avoid a potential nuclear war.
[7/31/23, 12:14:26] elin slavick: I thought of you, Peter last night at the crossroads screening because the guy who runs the UCLA film Archives was there and Ross Lipman who worked with the Bruce Connor archive on the restoration of crossroads which was made from archival footage from the national archives in DC. All kinds of archival. Plus Ross Lipman‘s animated/narrated PowerPoint is called the exploding digital inevitable.!

[8/1/23, 01:31:16] ~ Chris: Such a small world I met up with Ross in London the other day :3
[8/1/23, 08:18:23] Peter Sachs Collopy: I'm sorry you're having to deal with this eye condition! And it is really frustrating and challenging and in some cases even life-threatening how long the waits are to see medical specialists these days. I had an ear infection earlier this year that two primary care physicians somehow couldn't see and even though I knew exactly what was going on, it took months to see an ENT who then agreed with me and treated it. I hope your doctor was able to help, or that it gets better on its own very soon.
[8/1/23, 08:27:58] Peter Sachs Collopy: I had never listened to much Sinead O'Connor before her death, but I've been fascinated by and in awe of her as I have listened and read more. Her pursuit of both theology and music, her eclecticism in both, her moral voice, and just great songwriting and performance. I've been particularly obsessed with "Black Boys on Mopeds." https://youtu.be/n14lwdpYkAA
[8/1/23, 10:44:32] elin slavick: Thank you❤️
[8/1/23, 10:45:24] elin slavick: That is one of her best songs ever, and I’m glad you are learning about her and loving her! She was a prophet in my opinion, and so beautiful and brilliant and political.
[8/1/23, 12:53:51] Peter Sachs Collopy: The great Jude Doyle on Sinead O'Connor: https://t.co/BKxAsyugBJ
[8/1/23, 15:28:57] Catherine Geard: That entire amazing, with exception to her major hit which, I absolute amazing.

[8/1/23, 16:38:20] Peter Sachs Collopy: Your family and the mountains are both beautiful! And I'm glad you're getting some time away from work. Have the best vacation! I'm looking forward to another one together sometime.
[8/2/23, 07:01:24] Peter Sachs Collopy: Today is my last full day in the hospital. Tomorrow is discharge. I'm excited to get home and see Babka again, spend more and calmer time with Deanna, and sleep in our own bed. I also have too many ideas for things to do: I will continue some hand and leg exercises I learned here until I start outpatient therapy in about a week. I will walk laps on the second or third floor of the arcade building we live in; one thing I've been saying is that I have been very fortunate in pretty much every step of the process except the accident and spinal injury themselves, and Deanna and I certainly didn't know when we picked an apartment eight years ago that a pretty, open, empty walkway would be so valuable to each of us in recovering from surgery. I'm planning on studying piano with an app for both my finger dexterity and enjoyment, because I'm at the point of being able to play C-major scales decently but I don't remember anything more musically interesting. I got a copy of the Anatomy Coloring Book, also for both enjoyment and hand dexterity, and because I want to learn something about the nerves that pass through the spinal cord. And just spending some time watching TV with Deanna, and some reading, and hopefully visits from some of you.

[8/2/23, 07:06:26] Peter Sachs Collopy: I miss Berlin! It's been a while.
[8/2/23, 07:07:52] Joanna Radin: Hooray for homecomings!!!
[8/2/23, 07:08:05] Cameron Brinitzer: It’s actually my first time here, and I’m staying for 2 years
[8/2/23, 07:08:50] Peter Sachs Collopy: Oh wow! I'm sorry I completely missed you in LA. I will have to persuade someone to invite me to a conference or something in Berlin.
[8/2/23, 07:10:03] Cameron Brinitzer: I’m also sorry about that but I will of course be back to CA to visit home and I will see what I can do re invites :)
[8/2/23, 07:11:10] Peter Sachs Collopy: Allegra, emoji that aren't hearts or thumbs up! I did not realize that you could use all of them as reactions here.
[8/2/23, 07:11:51] Allegra Giovine: (a personal favorite)
[8/2/23, 07:20:41] Peter Sachs Collopy: I forgot one of the most important things I need to do when I get home, although certainly after cat cuddles, which is to sleep a lot. I think I've accumulated a lot of sleep debt in the hospital, and I'm only feeling a fraction of it, and I kind of expect it to hit me when I get home. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/2/23, 07:23:20] Beverly Socher-Lerner: Only weird emojis from now on! #challengeaccepted
[8/2/23, 08:11:14] Chris Boyd: I’m so glad to hear you’ll be coming home! It’s great that your apartment is so well set up for recovery.
[8/2/23, 08:14:32] Carlin Wing: so glad to hear you are about to go home from the hospital peter! i love the image of you parading around the arcade balcony. and i’m looking forward to visiting when i get back to LA! i used the sudnow method to start learning piano a while back - and admittedly dropped the ball - but was pretty into it as a method. i can see that being really nice for reintegrating finger and hand movement. but then the hanon method might also be interesting for the task and is the total opposite approach to learning to play. if at any point you are interested in recommendations of folks trained in craniosacral therapy who do home visits and have experience with spine injuries let me know. it’s a modality that can provide good support for spinal trauma because it involves super light - and sometimes even zero - touch. sending good wishes for the transition home and for lots of good long sleeping to recover from sleep debt and hospital time 💕
‎[8/2/23, 08:14:58] ~ Kathy Johnson: ‎image omitted
[8/2/23, 10:42:10] elin slavick: I’m so glad that you will be going home and it sounds like you are perfectly set up for recovery/rehabilitation. I would love to come visit you when you are ready for visitors. There is nothing like sleeping in your own bed! Sending all good wishes and positive energy for the transition. Thinking of you every day!
[8/2/23, 12:36:08] Alex White: I wonder how Babka will react. Is she a cuddler?
[8/2/23, 12:41:46] Anne Sullivan: This is such fantastic news!! I’m so glad you’ll be returning home tomorrow. Cat cuddles are so healing 😻 As is gentle TV time with loved ones. Do you have shows lined up that you’re planning to watch? 📺
[8/2/23, 12:43:08] Charlie Simon: You’re returning home, Justin Trudeau is single again, all is right in the world.
[8/2/23, 13:10:56] ~ Hillary: Yay, Peter! So glad you’ll be home soon! Great idea re the coloring book. Drawing is great for the hand, mind and sprit.
[8/2/23, 13:13:21] ~ Hillary: Ooh, nice emoji!
[8/2/23, 14:33:48] Peter Sachs Collopy: She is! She also sometimes shuns me when I return from a trip to communicate her disapproval, but this one was so long and so abrupt and my physical behavior will be different, so she might be kinder to me when I return.
[8/2/23, 14:35:09] elin slavick: 😻 meow 😸 🐱 🐈‍⬛ 🐈

[8/2/23, 14:40:25] Anne Sullivan: My old cat Clancy used to give us the cold shoulder to show her displeasure if we were gone too long. She’d jump up in a chair that faced the couch and turn her back to us. Once we had been sufficiently chastised, she’d cuddle with us, haha.
[8/3/23, 07:11:18] ~ Kewing: Hope this day goes smoothly! And that you collapse in bed for a great nap when you get home!
[8/3/23, 08:17:46] Kara Whatley: Happy Going Home Day! (Which sounds better than Happy Discharge Day…) 🤭
[8/3/23, 08:19:15] Peter Sachs Collopy: It does! Discharge Day sounds like it could involve firearms, though hopefully not in a way that harms anyone. I am feeling very ready for Going Home!

[8/3/23, 14:30:29] Lisa Cooper Vest: Peter, I'm so glad to see you at home! ❤️❤️❤️
[8/3/23, 17:08:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: As I predicted, I went home and crashed. When I just took a nap, Babka laid on my lap while I was napping for an hour and a half. I imagine she also fell asleep, because it would be kind of boring otherwise and because cats are so famous for napping that someone named a mediocre kind of nap after them. In any case, if you have to sleep with a cervical collar on, this was the coziest way to do so.
[8/3/23, 17:09:26] ~ Kewing: Yay! Glad to hear it!

[8/4/23, 14:17:06] Peter Sachs Collopy: One long nap so far, also with a cat, and also still feeling really tired. But glad to be home; I'll catch up on sleep eventually.
[8/4/23, 17:42:40] ~ Shawn Collopy Hardin: My apologies, Peter. I asked a few weeks ago about the title of a book I could send you, and within literal minutes, we had a large and scary fire at my job, and I found myself quickly distracted. We've been moving and closing on our house the last few weeks, and I've been busy with that. I see that you made your way home and I'm so happy to hear that! I've enjoyed reading back through all these conversations with your friends! You've got a collection of very interesting and special people keeping up with you. 

As far as over-committing to book purchases that you can never find time for, I'm very guilty of the same thing. I'm currently bouncing between 4 or 5 different books that I'm trying to get through, and I can't tell you how many I haven't even started yet 😅  That being said, I'm a big fan of audio books, as I can at least get through them on my daily commute to and from work or while I'm doing things around the house. It sounds like you have found so much to keep you busy at the moment, but I'd like to send a book nonetheless because that's just who I am. I was going to try to send it via Audible, but it does not look to be available there, so I'll send it to your home (if you wouldn't mind sharing your address with me).

I hope that your recovery is a little more comfortable now that you're back at home!
[8/4/23, 18:38:55] Peter Sachs Collopy: Hi Shawn! Thank you so much for the book! I wasn't reading much in the hospital anyway, but I am starting to here. My own audio listening is mostly podcasts, and I've never got into audiobooks; something about the dialogue being improvised feels more comfortable to me for audio.

Congratulations on your new house! The fire sounds really scary; I don't think I've ever actually been threatened by a fire, and it's an experience I hope to continue to avoid.
[8/5/23, 20:51:01] ~ Tom Nickel: Remember when we saw Evgeny Morozov at Stanford, Peter?  Here's a new podcast of his that tells the story of the amazing Cybersyn Project in Chile under Allende.  Goes into great depth so you can learn something even if you know the story some.  https://the-santiago-boys.com/
[8/5/23, 21:48:18] Peter Sachs Collopy: I saw this! Evgeny and I, and moreso Evgeny and history of technology as a community, had a little bit of conflict since then, related to his earlier writing about Cybersyn, the minimal credit he gave to Eden Medina's work on it, and the dismissive and combative attitude he had towards criticism of this. We have corresponded a little since then about Gregory Bateson's papers, but I'm approaching this podcast with some concerns and reservations because of that history, and I haven't listened to it yet.
[8/6/23, 15:10:00] ~ AH: So glad to read you are better and going home .
[8/6/23, 15:27:16] ~ Tom Nickel: And here I thought I was raising something of interest with neutral or positive emotional valence, oh well, sorry about the conflict, he is definitely riding the Cybersyn What If! wave.  You're riding the healing wave so approaching it with caution or not at all is a good move.
[8/8/23, 10:15:58] Peter Sachs Collopy: No problem! I do find Evgeny’s work really interesting and it inspired some of mine a long time ago. I just wish he were capable of accepting criticism.
[8/8/23, 10:23:21] Peter Sachs Collopy: Hi everyone! The transition to home has been difficult. A lot of it is just figuring out how to move in a different space, how to use a different shower, etc.

But I also had a hamstring muscle strain on my last day of inpatient physical therapy that got worse once I was home, and has prevented me from walking the distances I was there, which has really impeded my experience of being continually engaged in exercise.

And then I had food poisoning yesterday, which would have been painful anyway but was really not fun because Deanna and I had to worry about whether it was actually a symptom of spinal cord injury and thus whether to go the the ER—but now that I’m feeling better, we’re pretty sure it was actually food poisoning. If you’re in LA, please do not order food from Sushi With Attitude; we withdraw all prior recommendations.

I am feeling better today, drinking some broth and gradually stretching my hamstrings. I hope you’re doing well too!
[8/8/23, 10:26:00] Anne Sullivan: Ugh, I’m so sorry to hear that! Thanks for sharing these updates, though.

I saw in the history of this chat that someone asked if you’d like help with food. Maybe gift cards to favorite restaurants that deliver, or a delivery service, or groceries? Let us know if that would be helpful now that you’re home!
[8/8/23, 10:51:30] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you Anne! Yes, we would welcome any kind of help with food. I don't think any favorite restaurants do their own delivery, but we would certainly use gift cards in DoorDash.

Some recommendations for places we like which haven't given us food poisoning, on which we would likely spend such gifts: CoCo Ichibanya (Japanese curry), Dune (falafel, hummus, etc.), Pine and Crane (Taiwanese), Triple Beam Pizza (Roman style), Fat Dragon (Americanized Chinese food), Tulsi (vegetarian Indian food), Braazo Pizza.

We also welcome home-cooked vegetarian food from those local!

Thank you for asking!
[8/8/23, 10:55:35] Carlin Wing: tyu for this guidance peter (and anne for asking the question)! do you have a preference for which email address or text phone number we use to send door dash gift cards?
[8/8/23, 10:56:08] Kara Whatley: I think we can manage some Indian cuisine. ☺️ Any favorites that IC should know about?
[8/8/23, 10:56:37] Peter Sachs Collopy: Oh sure! Thank you! peter@collopy.net or 216-544-1564.
[8/8/23, 14:47:19] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you Kara, and IC! I love potato dishes like aloo gobi or aloo jeera. And we both love saag paneer. But we would also be excited to try whatever vegetarian food IC is most proud of or most enjoys making.
[8/8/23, 16:20:22] ~ Kathy Johnson: Peter, thanks for saying yes to the gift cards! This is something many of us can help with to feel like we’re contributing towards you getting better ❤️‍🩹
[8/8/23, 16:22:55] Alex White: I wish I lived near enough to bring you homemade food
[8/8/23, 16:23:14] Beverly Socher-Lerner: I would cook so many mountains if I could figure out how to get it to you!!!
[8/8/23, 17:49:44] Kara Whatley: IC asks if you eat eggs? He’s planning a menu that includes baigan bharta and aloo bindi. How do you feel about okra?
[8/8/23, 17:51:48] Peter Sachs Collopy: This sounds so delicious! We do eat eggs, and are pro-okra.
[8/8/23, 18:00:43] ~ Kathy Johnson: ‎This message was deleted.
[8/8/23, 18:47:42] Beverly Socher-Lerner: TEAM OKRA. This pacifist will go to the mat for that one. 😁
[8/8/23, 19:56:34] elin slavick: Love okra
[8/9/23, 05:56:32] ~ Kewing: Are you feeling better today, Pete?
[8/9/23, 17:06:24] Peter Sachs Collopy: I am feeling better, but still not well. My stomach feels weak, so I'm not eating much, so I feel weak. I did have a good outpatient PT assessment, and learned that my left leg issue is not a strained muscle but my tibial nerve, which means I can’t do much leg exercise right now, but I can do some simple exercises to mobilize the nerve. I kind of feel like things are just slower and more painful than they have been, and I have to get through this rough patch to get back to walking more and exercising.
[8/9/23, 17:08:59] Chris Boyd: I’m sorry you got food poisoning, Peter! If you’re ever in Irvine, I recommend against Gatten Sushi for the same reason.
[8/9/23, 17:16:55] ~ Hillary: Ugh Peter, rough patch indeed! Do you know the BRAT diet for stomach issues? Might be helpful for a bit.
[8/9/23, 17:31:09] Daniel Frishberg: Peter was in Irvine recently! But we didn't go there
[8/9/23, 17:31:55] Daniel Frishberg: It had a location near Pasadena too, but actually all locations appear to be permanently closed
[8/9/23, 17:33:13] Chris Boyd: That’s just as well
[8/9/23, 17:33:21] Daniel Frishberg: Apparently there were locations in the Valley, Rowland Heights, and Koreatown also
[8/12/23, 17:31:01] Garth Donald: If you need a bit of levity today Peter,  I changed the oil on my car and put the wrong oil in.   Ha ha!
[8/12/23, 18:36:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: That sounds frustrating, actually! Will it cause any problems? Did you have to remove it? Things I have avoided learning about cars.
[8/12/23, 18:51:52] Chris Boyd: I don’t know much about cars, but I know the vacuum pumps in my lab would be screwed up if I were to put the wrong oil in them.
[8/12/23, 18:53:35] Charlie Simon: Unless it’s a catastrophic weight or viscosity difference and the engine was run hard it can be drained and replaced along with the oil filter that is changed with every change. Definitely a pain in the butt but mostly an annoying tune suck
[8/12/23, 18:53:49] Charlie Simon: *time. Also a bit of a mess
[8/12/23, 18:55:21] Chris Boyd: Just be sure to dispose of the old oil in an environmentally benign manner!

[8/13/23, 10:43:44] Peter Sachs Collopy: Cleveland friends: Prior to my accident, I was planning to visit this month to see the musical Fun Home, one of my favorite works of art in any medium, at Cain Park. My friend Rachel Woods is music directing. I'm not going to make it, but you should really see it. Queer self-discovery, a fraught father-daughter relationship, a funeral home. Part of it technically takes place at Oberlin College. https://www.cainpark.com/458/Fun-Home
[8/13/23, 10:44:19] ~ Maurie Kathan: I just saw it in dc! It’s great
[8/13/23, 10:45:45] Charlie Simon: Big Obie alumni energy.
[8/13/23, 10:45:54] Peter Sachs Collopy: And if you're not in Cleveland, or you are and want to prepare for the show, I also really recommend the comic book memoir on which the musical is based: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1835957W/Fun_Home
[8/13/23, 10:46:55] Charlie Simon: Alison Bechdel is also responsible for the Bechdel Test!
[8/13/23, 10:47:19] ~ Kewing: Very good production.
[8/13/23, 10:50:11] Peter Sachs Collopy: I'm glad to hear it! I haven't seen it as a community production before, but I imagine it could work really well.
[8/13/23, 10:53:06] ~ Kewing: My friend Sarah May, longtime Cleveland theater director, collected the props for her daughter Sarah May Cullinan, who directed. Sets were great. And, of course, Yay, Rachel!
[8/13/23, 10:53:43] Peter Sachs Collopy: An update from here: I'm doing pretty well, if still held back by this entrapped tibial nerve in my left leg. Our cat Babka was sick yesterday, so it has been a stressful weekend. She seems to be feeling well today too, though. I'm typing this on my ergonomic keyboard, which does not hurt me but is a lot slower than it was before my accident; I expect I'll gradually pick up speed, though.
[8/13/23, 10:59:54] Peter Sachs Collopy: Another good thing, preceded by a bad thing: After a few nights sleeping at home, I started feeling intense and painful muscle knots on both shoulder blades. My physical therapist said this is normal as my shoulder muscles take on work from my neck. I hadn't felt it in the hospital, though.

Separately: My colleagues at Caltech Library knew I really missed Babka and gave me a stuffed cat, who I have recently named Sally and who I slept hugging in the hospital. When I got home, though, I set her aside because I had a real cat cuddling my feed every night.

So, Deanna put these together and suggested that hugging Sally while I sleep might relieve my shoulder pain, and indeed it does! A big thank you to Deanna for this insight, and to my Caltech Library colleagues for Sally, who has been literally making this experience less painful.
[8/13/23, 11:42:27] elin slavick: I am not sure if your body is ready for this, but when it is, I found one of the best rolfers in the world in Pasadena, and I am happy to share his information with you. (I may have already shared this information with you, because as I recall, when I was at Caltech, you were having some back issues?) He fixed all of my little aches and pains in my jaw and neck and back and shoulders. It’s probably too intense for now while you were still recovering, but I bet you would love it once you are well enough to go. Thinking of you and keep hugging your cat Pillow and feeling/receiving all the love and care we are all feeling for you!
[8/13/23, 13:59:49] Garth Donald: 30 instead of 20.  Just a drain, filter xchange, and refill. I just learned how to change my oil,  almost 40 and never done it before!
[8/13/23, 15:16:30] Joanna Radin: Deanna is a genius!
[8/13/23, 15:43:27] Peter Sachs Collopy: She has noticed so many of these correlations and solutions over the last ten days! She is incredible!

[8/14/23, 09:35:10] ~ Kewing: I thought of you last night, Pete,  as I watched Unrest at the Cinematheque, which explores anarchism in 1870s Switzerland. When movies return to your agenda, I really recommend it. It’s beautiful and odd and also concerns ideas like capitalism, power, wage inequality, sexism, mechanization, socialism, and other things. Maybe you’ve even heard of one of the main characters, Pyotr Kropotkin. The movie’s packed with ideas (and some humor) I think you’d enjoy. I’ll let you know if I find out it’s streaming somewhere.
[8/14/23, 10:39:12] Peter Sachs Collopy: ‎You deleted this message.
[8/14/23, 10:43:50] Peter Sachs Collopy: This sounds terrific! I would love to see it. And I suppose it's just been screened in Cleveland already, but I wonder if my friends at Rhizome House, the new anarchist community center on Lee Road, would be interested in screening it as well.

Kropotkin is a fascinating figure both in the history of anarchism and in the history of science; he derived some of his political ideas about cooperation and mutual aid (a phrase he popularized) from his work as a geographer and biologist, observing cooperation among animals. And he of course argued that Darwinism was thus limited and incomplete in its focus on competition.

When I taught the history of evolutionary thought, I assigned a bit of Kropotkin. I'm really proud of this syllabus and should probably teach it again, maybe in some non-college context, so here's that part: https://collopy.net/teaching/2017/evolution/index.html#politics

[8/14/23, 11:32:41] ~ Kewing: Wow. She showed me that pic last week, I think, before I’d seen the movie. :—)
[8/14/23, 11:33:53] ~ Kewing: It’s streaming on Mubi apparently.

[8/14/23, 18:30:37] Chris Boyd: Bravo!
[8/15/23, 09:02:14] Cameron Brinitzer: This is a terrific syllabus!
[8/15/23, 19:13:09] elin slavick: No kidding! I wish I could’ve taken the class with Peter!
[8/16/23, 11:23:50] ~ Kewing: That is quite an impressive syllabus. I can see why you’re proud. 

It reminded me of our Darwin conversations at Phoenix. 

Wonder if you’re familiar with Kristin Ohlson’s Sweet in Tooth and Claw: Stories of Generosity and Cooperation in the Natural World. She’s a friend and former Clevelander (lives in Portland now). I haven’t finished it, but now that I know about Kropotkin I wouldn’t be surprised if she references him.
[8/16/23, 13:25:17] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you! I suppose that syllabus was a life's work in a way, or at least stuff I was thinking about from 16 to 31, so a decade and a half, including writing with you!

I haven't heard of Ohlson's book, but it does sound like an heir of Kropotkin's work.
[8/16/23, 13:35:01] ~ Tom Nickel: Wow, you're not kidding when you call it, "substantial reading assignments." Glad to see you included so many of my favorites, especially Teilhard ... guess there wasn't space to work Velikovsky into the discussion of Catastrophism.  I think Kropotkin's best days are still ahead of him.
[8/16/23, 13:44:04] Peter Sachs Collopy: True! It's approximately chronological, so Velikovsky doesn't fit the period when we covered catastrophism. There's some great history of science work on how much Velikovsky motivated orthodox scientists to formulate the category of pseudoscience and campaign against it, though, in Michael Gordin's book The Pseudoscience Wars. It certainly fits into the narrative of this course; I leaned on Dobzhansky a lot as a sort of guide for the 30s–70s, and I think he shows up there too, although I think more worked up about Lysenko than Velikovsky.
[8/23/23, 14:24:00] ~ Kewing: How are you coming along, Pete? Are rehab appointments regular?
[8/23/23, 14:49:49] Peter Sachs Collopy: I'm doing pretty well! I have only had my evaluation appointments for outpatient PT and OT, because scheduling is difficult on their end. But I do have appointments scheduled over the next several weeks. The tibial nerve in my left leg feels partly better but is still holding me back from walking more than short distances, which is the main thing bothering me. And my sleep is weird; I'm awake for at least an hour and a half in the middle of the night, which means I'm really relying on naps to get enough sleep. But this is all manageable, and I'm certainly feeling better than the first couple weeks at home.
[8/23/23, 14:50:19] Chris Boyd: I’m glad to hear things are improving!
[8/23/23, 14:52:54] Peter Sachs Collopy: We went for followup x-rays of my neck today, and I have a followup appointment with my surgeon Friday; hopefully my neck has healed well and I can stop wearing a cervical collar.
[8/23/23, 14:53:24] Chris Boyd: I wonder if that’ll help with your sleep?
[8/23/23, 14:56:36] Peter Sachs Collopy: Maybe! I don't think I'll be able to sleep exactly my usual way still, because my usual way is falling asleep on my front and then rolling onto my side, and I don't think I'll be able/allowed for a while to turn my head 90 degrees to lay on my front. But still, sleeping on my back without the collar will be more comfortable than with it. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/23/23, 15:14:37] Garth Donald: How is your mattress Peter?  I switched to one of those magic internet foam mattresses a few years ago and the change in my sleep and mornings was enormous.
[8/23/23, 15:21:34] Catherine Geard: I had to learn to fall asleep a different way after my accident because of the nerve damage. I also remember not sleeping well and in spurts. I chalked it up to the change from being active to becoming practically immobile so quickly. It takes time. If allowed try to do home pt exercise. Might help with strength but also with burning some energy.
[8/23/23, 15:25:56] Peter Sachs Collopy: My psychiatrist uncle says it's “trauma sleep,” feeling unsafe and being awake to keep watch. I am doing PT exercises, but I agree more exercise would help with sleep. I've been thinking about setting up my bike with a trainer so I can ride it stationary… but first I need to go get it from South Pasadena PD.
[8/23/23, 15:26:35] Peter Sachs Collopy: Interesting! We have been talking about getting a new mattress, but it feels like a big decision. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/23/23, 15:28:05] Catherine Geard: Can I help you with that? Erik has an SUV. It will fit in there.
[8/23/23, 15:28:59] Peter Sachs Collopy: Thank you! Maybe! I’ll let you know.
[8/24/23, 01:31:38] ~ Chris: My advice is get a flippable one not a single sided (delivered folded) unless you plan on changing it more frequently than normal as our high end single sided deformed more quickly than a trad flippable
