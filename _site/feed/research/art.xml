*Crossing Over* is an interdisciplinary publication that looks at one prominent university—the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena—as a site for scientific and artistic image production.

This course will explore the history of interactions between art, science, and technology, and how to curate exhibitions on the subject. It is partly based on the instructors’ work, as part of the Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time 2024 program on art, science, and LA, to develop a multi-sited, campus-wide exhibition at Caltech on Caltech’s own uses of visual culture over the last century to produce science, to communicate it, and to foster scientific identity and community. Our readings will emphasize the 20th century US, and sometimes specifically Caltech’s own history, but student projects may extend beyond this geographical and chronological context.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The course will be divided into three modules:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Art and Science:</b> During the first part of the semester, we will think about the relationships between art, science, technology, and visual culture more generally, studying foundational texts on scientific illustration, the influence of science on modern and contemporary art, technological art, and the architecture of scientific institutions.</li>
	<li><b>Curating:</b> The second part of the semester takes an in-depth look at the history of exhibitions, both in the science and visual arts realms, and explores the nature and roles of archives and collections as sources for display. We will pay particular attention to contemporary curatorial theory and practice as it has evolved from the 1960s to the present. There will be site visits to the Benton Museum at Pomona College, where we will see an installation by California Light and Space artist Helen Pashgian; the Huntington Library, where we view a site-specific installation by artist Lita Albuquerque and meet with senior curators working on art and science exhibitions; and the Caltech Archives and Special Collections, where we will explore the records kept by scientific institutions. Other guests will join the conversation to deepen our understanding of discourse and standards in the field.</li>
	<li><b>Disciplinary Histories and Student Presentations:</b> During the third part of the semester, we will focus on the histories of visual culture in specific scientific disciplines, as well as art and architecture, often reading case studies from Caltech’s own history. Students will curate, design, and present possible exhibition displays on these topics drawing on the Caltech Archives and other local collections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the semester, students will investigate a range of visual practices at Caltech and other scientific institutions according to the specific scientific, artistic, and institutional functions they serve. What kinds of information do scientific images convey, and how do we best look at them in their varying contexts? How do we account for the choices scientists and artists make when they represent their work, and what cultural biases or preferences might their images contain? How do scientific images relate to other images in art, technology, and popular culture?</p>

<p>This course does not require any specific background preparation. For those unfamiliar with the academic study of visual culture, additional reading in James Elkins and Erna Fiorentini, <cite>Visual Worlds: Looking, Images, Visual Disciplines</cite> (Oxford University Press, 2020) may be useful for context.</p>

<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Understand the complex interactions between art, science, technology, and visual culture in the 20th and early 21st centuries, especially as they relate to the California Institute of Technology, other American science institutions, and Southern California.</li>
	<li>Navigate art and science discourses in the humanities.</li>
	<li>Reflect on and engage critically with trends and issues in contemporary curatorial practice.</li>
	<li>Collaborate with project partners.</li>
	<li>Strengthen research, writing, and presentation skills, communicating in a variety of formats and for diverse audiences.</li>
	<li>Create compelling exhibitions with an understanding of different spaces and their design, as well as the selection, care, and management of display objects.</li>
	<li>Know artists, scholars, curators, and design professionals working in the field.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<ol>
	<li><b>Exhibition review</b> (500 words) of a local exhibition of your choice which engages with both art and science. Specific guidelines for this review will be posted online and discussed in class. Reviews are due electronically before class on October 24, 2022.</li>
	<li><b>Exhibition proposal</b> of a concept, items, didactic text, and layout for a small display on an art/science theme either chosen from a list provided by the course instructors or proposed by the student. Elements of the proposal will include a short introductory text (500 words), a checklist of 15–30 display items, a sample wall text (250 words) and didactic exhibition label (100 words), and space selection and layout/fabrication ideas. You may work independently or collaborate with one or more partners. In addition to handing in proposal materials, each student will present on their proposal during the third portion of the semester. Your presentation will be assessed based on the comprehensiveness and originality of your ideas; their viability in a real-life gallery, museum, or library setting; and your creative communication skills. Specific guidelines for a successful exhibition proposal will be posted online and discussed in class. Proposals are due on your assigned presentation day, between November 7 and December 12.</li>
	<li><b>Curatorial essay</b> (15–20 pages, no more than 5000 words) providing historical, cultural, aesthetic, or other scholarly analysis of your proposal exhibition, or, with permission of the instructors, of another topic. Specific guidelines for the creation of a curatorial essay will be posted online and discussed in class. Curatorial essays are due electronically on December 16.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your grade for the course will be based 20% on the exhibition review, 30% each on the exhibition proposal and curatorial essay, and 20% on your engaged and insightful participation in class.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss readings during every class, so please read everything assigned before the class meeting it’s listed under. Please submit assignments by email to both instructors.</p>

This course will explore the history of interactions between art, science, and technology, and how to curate exhibitions on the subject. It is partly based on the instructors’ work, as part of the Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time 2024 program on art, science, and LA, to develop a multi-sited, campus-wide exhibition at Caltech on Caltech’s own uses of visual culture over the last century to produce science, to communicate it, and to foster scientific identity and community. Our readings will emphasize the 20th century US, and sometimes specifically Caltech’s own history, but student projects may extend beyond this geographical and chronological context.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Video and the Self: Closed Circuit | Feedback | Narcissism</title><link href="https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Video and the Self: Closed Circuit | Feedback | Narcissism" /><published>2022-02-24T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self/"><![CDATA[A chapter which I guest edited:

The relationship between video and the self has been one of the central concerns of video theory. Prominent artists such as Vito Acconci, Dan Graham, Joan Jonas, and Bruce Nauman have organized their artistic practice around mediated self-observation, either using video to document and complicate their own expressions of self or building installations with which viewers can see and experience themselves in new ways. Such self-portraiture is the subject of the most widely cited essay in this volume, Rosalind Krauss’s 1976 “Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism,” and of several essays responding to it.

Even before videotape became an artistic medium in 1965, though, video, self-observation, and narcissism were already the subjects of a theoretical literature produced by psychiatrists and psychologists. If patients saw how disordered they appeared to others, some psychotherapists suggested, they might be motivated to change. Other clinicians rewatched sessions with patients so that either could pause the video to discuss emotions or experiences which they hadn’t articulated, essentially putting themselves back into a moment in the conversation. Some of the most prominent artists and theorists working with video were directly influenced by this video therapy tradition.]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="technology" /><category term="media" /><category term="video" /><category term="cybernetics" /><category term="consciousness" /><category term="visual culture" /><category term="human sciences" /><category term="medicine" /><category term="art" /><category term="psychiatry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A chapter which I guest edited: The relationship between video and the self has been one of the central concerns of video theory.

Tools that had previously been available only in television studios turned up in art galleries, in psychiatric hospitals, and in the Black Panther Party. This cultural portability was facilitated by a material portability: the technology got smaller, it got cheaper, it got lighter. For instance, this 1970 Sony camera is part of a piece of equipment called a portapak. Between the camera and the deck it was a complete video production studio that was light enough for somebody to carry around and was battery-powered. These recorders used half-inch open reel magnetic tape.

Many of the people using these new video technologies, from artists to psychiatrists to political activists, were particularly interested in what video meant for consciousness. They were interested in the experience of watching yourself on a television monitor. For some psychiatrists this was a self-confrontation experience that could force a person to confront how other people saw them and not merely experience themselves through their own impressions. For some artists this was a meditative experience, that watching yourself could be a path to holistic self-understanding.

Many of these experimental videographers were also interested in pointing cameras at their own monitors, and in the kaleidoscopic visual effects that appeared when they did this. And they referred to both these kaleidoscopic effects, this practice of pointing cameras at monitors, and to watching oneself on a monitor, as feedback, borrowing a term from the field of cybernetics. This idea of taking the message of a system that comes out of that system, like what you see coming out of a television, and putting it back into that system in order to make it reflect upon itself was something that they understood as both an optical and electronic phenomenon that could be harnessed to aesthetic ends, and as a psychological phenomenon that could lead to new kinds of human understanding.

They also thought about this on a broader social scale. If you could watch yourself and understand yourself better, perhaps watching other people, or watching the world through other people's eyes—watching video that they had shot—could help you understand others better. And this seemed a path to a kind of universal consciousness that had been described by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin as the noosphere—the global mind—or by Marshall McLuhan, who as a media theorist was a big influence on experimental video, as the global village.]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="presentations" /><category term="video" /><category term="consciousness" /><category term="visual culture" /><category term="cybernetics" /><category term="media" /><category term="technology" /><category term="art" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1960s, video recording technology became portable.

Portable video recorders like the <a href="http://experimentaltvcenter.org/sony-av-3400-porta-pak">Sony AV-3400</a>—universally known to users as “portapaks”—brought video out of the television studio and into both the artist&#8217;s studio and the streets, where they were used to document political activism, countercultural exuberance, and everyday life. This is the moment curator Lori Zippay captures in <a href="http://diabeacon.org/exhibitions/main/118"><cite>Circa 1971: Early Video &#038; Film from the EAI Archives</cite></a>, an exhibit drawn on the collections of <a href="http://eai.org/">Electronic Arts Intermix</a> on display at <a href="http://diabeacon.org/">Dia:Beacon</a> through December 31.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="http://diabeacon.org/exhibitions/page/118/1665">As Zippay writes</a>, “performance and visual artists, political activists, cybernetic theorists, filmmakers, <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10457">Fluxus</a> provocateurs, and self-described video freaks and electronic geeks all contributed to the fluid mix—and creative friction—of the emergent video art scene.” She portrays this diversity of early video by bringing together 15 video productions and eight related films from 1970, 1971, and 1972. This tight periodization means the show, like an archaeological dig site, reveals a single stratum of video&#8217;s early history rather than a chronology of video art.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Mayday Realtime" src="/images/mayday.jpg" width="367" height="205">
<p>The most fascinating works are those sometimes described as video verité, which provide glimpses into an unrehearsed past. In <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/mayday-realtime"><cite>Mayday Realtime</cite></a>, for example, <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=370">David Cort</a> walks and drives around Washington, D.C. on <a href="http://libcom.org/library/ending-war-inventing-movement-mayday-1971">May Day 1971</a>, documenting antiwar demonstrations and the police response. Cort, founder of a video collective called the <a href="http://videofreex.com/">Videofreex</a> who lived in a communal house in the Catskills, consistently turned up with a camera at countercultural events like the <a href="http://bethelwoodscenter.org/museum/festivalhistory.aspx">Woodstock Festival</a> and the <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chicago7/chicago7.html">Chicago Seven trial</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://projectshirley.com/bio.html">Shirley Clarke</a>’s <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=5912">	<cite>The Tee Pee Video Space Troupe: The First Years</cite></a> portrays cultural moments both more mundane and more glamorous than Cort’s May Day. In one segment, Clarke carouses with John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and Andy Warhol. “Video gives me something to do at parties,” Clarke tells the audience with an intertitle. Like many other videographers, Clarke—already an Academy Award winning filmmaker—was fascinated by the unique features of the video medium. As she tells a silent, posing Ono, her camera recorded sound, as film cameras could not. (Recording sound for film requires separate recording equipment.)</p>
<p>In the second segment of <cite>The Tee Pee Video Space Troupe</cite>, Shirley Clarke and Arthur C. Clarke—no relation—experiment with the interactions between two new gadgets. The science fiction writer points a laser at the filmmaker’s video camera, producing beautiful “sunbursts” and kaleidoscopic images. She has set up monitors displaying the video being recorded, so he watches himself and the abstractions he produces in real time, a mirroring practice characteristic of experimental video.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Vertical Roll" src="/images/jonas_vertical_web.jpg" width="250" height="188">
<p>Indeed, many of the more explicitly artistic videos in <cite>Circa 1971</cite> are subversive self-portraits. <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=408">Joan Jonas</a>’ <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/vertical-roll">	<cite>Vertical Roll</cite></a> consists of sensual explorations of the artist’s body interrupted by the vertical rolling characteristic of a poorly calibrated CRT television in time to a violent clanging sound. This disruption of the viewing experience challenges viewers to question the routine objectification of women’s bodies. Similarly, in <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/i-am-making-art"><cite>I Am Making Art</cite></a> <a href="http://baldessari.org/">John Baldessari</a> challenges the category of art itself by incessantly repeating the titular phrase while moving through the video frame.</p>
<p>As Zippay notes in her essay, these pieces convey “an analog—that is, slowed-down—experience of time” compared to that of 2012. The sparse arrangement of the self portraits—displayed on large video monitors set along the wall of the gallery like paintings, with no seating—compounds this sense of slowness. Since each of six is around 20 minutes long, I found myself circulating among them, returning to those I’d already watched for a few minutes to see how the artists were doing.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Self-Portraits" src="/images/11_09_circa_image04.jpg" width="400" height="267">
<p>Experimental videographers generally embraced the ability to record continuously afforded by cheap tape—which, if you ran out, could also be recorded over. The ideal of cinema without editing pioneered by Warhol on film (and at least once on video) became common among videographers, and is evidenced here both by documentary works like <cite>Mayday Realtime</cite> and consciously artistic ones like <cite>I Am Making Art</cite>. It was often in editing, though, that experimental video most effectively demonstrated its emotional range.</p>
<p>In a series of <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=2991">	<cite>Media Primers</cite></a>, three members of the video collective <a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/e/history.html">Raindance</a> edited together segments from their diverse tape collection. I was particularly struck by <a href="http://ira-schneider.com/artist/">Ira Schneider</a>’s contribution, perhaps the least cerebral of the three, in which a hippie playing guitar and singing euphorically is intercut with footage of a campaign event for Richard Nixon and scuffles in the audience at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert">Altamont</a>.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="TV Cello Premiere" src="/images/11_09_circa_image02.jpg" width="400" height="267">
<p><cite>Circa 1971</cite> also includes a handful of short films from the era, which are projected rather than displayed on CRTs. <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=13739">	<cite>TV Cello Premiere</cite></a> by <a href="http://paikstudios.com/">Nam June Paik</a> and <a href="http://hamsadesign.com/vidfilm/JudYalkut.html">Jud Yalkut</a>, shown at the exhibit’s entrance, depicts one of Paik’s collaborations with <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=344">Charlotte Moorman</a>. The cellist played a one-stringed cello constructed by Paik, <a href="http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/881">	<cite>TV Cello</cite></a>, which displayed the performance, other cellists, and broadcast television on its three TV screens.</p>
<p>Many of the works in <cite>Circa 1971</cite>, most notably <cite>TV Cello Premiere</cite> and <cite>Vertical Roll</cite>,  reveal particular technical features of the video technology used to create them. This is not the technology on which they’re displayed, however; despite being about analog media, <cite>Circa 1971</cite> is an exhibit of digital reproductions. Given the fragility and glitchiness of analog video, such concessions to practicality are necessary to display this work, but they leave the analog video medium itself absent from the gallery. An exhibit which more fully portrayed analog video as both a technology and an artistic medium might feature a portapak on a pedestal in the center of the gallery, surrounded by the art it helped create.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>If you’ve come here after asking yourself (or Google) what cybernetics is, I recommend starting with Bernard Geoghegan and Benjamin Peters’ entry “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect041">Cybernetics</a>,” from the <cite>International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy</cite>, and Geoffrey Bowker’s “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/285691">How to Be Universal: Some Cybernetic Strategies, 1943–70</a>.” Ronald Kline’s <cite><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/cybernetics-moment-or-why-we-call-our-age-the-information-age/oclc/890127838">The Cybernetics Moment</a></cite> is the synthetic history the field has been waiting for. William Aspray’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1985.10018">The Scientific Conceptualization of Information: A Survey</a>” places cybernetics in the context of developments in computing and information theory, while Peter Galison’s “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343893">The Ontology of the Enemy: Norbert Wiener and the Cybernetic Vision</a>” is a classic account of the field’s military origins. The texts listed below survey the many forms cybernetics took in the decades that followed.</p>
	
<p>This bibliography is limited in three ways: It includes only books and articles which focus on cybernetics rather than the related histories of cyborgs and information theory; it includes only texts in English, though there are also substantial French and German literatures on the subject; and it excludes articles and dissertations that have been superseded by books by the same authors. Within these limitations, I welcome references to additional books and articles. I last updated this list on November 26, 2023.</p>
