*Crossing Over* is an interdisciplinary publication that looks at one prominent university—the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena—as a site for scientific and artistic image production. Uncovering the rich pictorial record embedded in its Archives and Special Collections, a team of visual culture scholars examines Caltech through a series of tightly focused case studies. How, the authors ask, have science and engineering institutions like Caltech used scientific representation, art, and architecture to construct themselves and produce discovery and invention? This book reveals new facets of life and work at Caltech that will be illuminating even to those familiar with the school, showcasing views that informed—and were informed by—the vibrant visual culture of Southern California.

This course will explore the history of interactions between art, science, and technology, and how to curate exhibitions on the subject. It is partly based on the instructors’ work, as part of the Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time 2024 program on art, science, and LA, to develop a multi-sited, campus-wide exhibition at Caltech on Caltech’s own uses of visual culture over the last century to produce science, to communicate it, and to foster scientific identity and community. Our readings will emphasize the 20th century US, and sometimes specifically Caltech’s own history, but student projects may extend beyond this geographical and chronological context.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The course will be divided into three modules:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Art and Science:</b> During the first part of the semester, we will think about the relationships between art, science, technology, and visual culture more generally, studying foundational texts on scientific illustration, the influence of science on modern and contemporary art, technological art, and the architecture of scientific institutions.</li>
	<li><b>Curating:</b> The second part of the semester takes an in-depth look at the history of exhibitions, both in the science and visual arts realms, and explores the nature and roles of archives and collections as sources for display. We will pay particular attention to contemporary curatorial theory and practice as it has evolved from the 1960s to the present. There will be site visits to the Benton Museum at Pomona College, where we will see an installation by California Light and Space artist Helen Pashgian; the Huntington Library, where we view a site-specific installation by artist Lita Albuquerque and meet with senior curators working on art and science exhibitions; and the Caltech Archives and Special Collections, where we will explore the records kept by scientific institutions. Other guests will join the conversation to deepen our understanding of discourse and standards in the field.</li>
	<li><b>Disciplinary Histories and Student Presentations:</b> During the third part of the semester, we will focus on the histories of visual culture in specific scientific disciplines, as well as art and architecture, often reading case studies from Caltech’s own history. Students will curate, design, and present possible exhibition displays on these topics drawing on the Caltech Archives and other local collections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the semester, students will investigate a range of visual practices at Caltech and other scientific institutions according to the specific scientific, artistic, and institutional functions they serve. What kinds of information do scientific images convey, and how do we best look at them in their varying contexts? How do we account for the choices scientists and artists make when they represent their work, and what cultural biases or preferences might their images contain? How do scientific images relate to other images in art, technology, and popular culture?</p>

<p>This course does not require any specific background preparation. For those unfamiliar with the academic study of visual culture, additional reading in James Elkins and Erna Fiorentini, <cite>Visual Worlds: Looking, Images, Visual Disciplines</cite> (Oxford University Press, 2020) may be useful for context.</p>

<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Understand the complex interactions between art, science, technology, and visual culture in the 20th and early 21st centuries, especially as they relate to the California Institute of Technology, other American science institutions, and Southern California.</li>
	<li>Navigate art and science discourses in the humanities.</li>
	<li>Reflect on and engage critically with trends and issues in contemporary curatorial practice.</li>
	<li>Collaborate with project partners.</li>
	<li>Strengthen research, writing, and presentation skills, communicating in a variety of formats and for diverse audiences.</li>
	<li>Create compelling exhibitions with an understanding of different spaces and their design, as well as the selection, care, and management of display objects.</li>
	<li>Know artists, scholars, curators, and design professionals working in the field.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<ol>
	<li><b>Exhibition review</b> (500 words) of a local exhibition of your choice which engages with both art and science. Specific guidelines for this review will be posted online and discussed in class. Reviews are due electronically before class on October 24, 2022.</li>
	<li><b>Exhibition proposal</b> of a concept, items, didactic text, and layout for a small display on an art/science theme either chosen from a list provided by the course instructors or proposed by the student. Elements of the proposal will include a short introductory text (500 words), a checklist of 15–30 display items, a sample wall text (250 words) and didactic exhibition label (100 words), and space selection and layout/fabrication ideas. You may work independently or collaborate with one or more partners. In addition to handing in proposal materials, each student will present on their proposal during the third portion of the semester. Your presentation will be assessed based on the comprehensiveness and originality of your ideas; their viability in a real-life gallery, museum, or library setting; and your creative communication skills. Specific guidelines for a successful exhibition proposal will be posted online and discussed in class. Proposals are due on your assigned presentation day, between November 7 and December 12.</li>
	<li><b>Curatorial essay</b> (15–20 pages, no more than 5000 words) providing historical, cultural, aesthetic, or other scholarly analysis of your proposal exhibition, or, with permission of the instructors, of another topic. Specific guidelines for the creation of a curatorial essay will be posted online and discussed in class. Curatorial essays are due electronically on December 16.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your grade for the course will be based 20% on the exhibition review, 30% each on the exhibition proposal and curatorial essay, and 20% on your engaged and insightful participation in class.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss readings during every class, so please read everything assigned before the class meeting it’s listed under. Please submit assignments by email to both instructors.</p>

This course will explore the history of interactions between art, science, and technology, and how to curate exhibitions on the subject. It is partly based on the instructors’ work, as part of the Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time 2024 program on art, science, and LA, to develop a multi-sited, campus-wide exhibition at Caltech on Caltech’s own uses of visual culture over the last century to produce science, to communicate it, and to foster scientific identity and community. Our readings will emphasize the 20th century US, and sometimes specifically Caltech’s own history, but student projects may extend beyond this geographical and chronological context.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Behind the Book: Escape from Earth</title><link href="https://collopy.net/discussions/2022/escape-from-earth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Behind the Book: Escape from Earth" /><published>2022-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://collopy.net/discussions/2022/escape-from-earth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collopy.net/discussions/2022/escape-from-earth/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="Caltech" /><category term="politics" /><category term="technology" /><category term="technopolitics" /><category term="engineering" /><category term="communism" /><category term="California" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Video and the Self: Closed Circuit | Feedback | Narcissism</title><link href="https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Video and the Self: Closed Circuit | Feedback | Narcissism" /><published>2022-02-24T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collopy.net/writing/2022/video-and-the-self/"><![CDATA[A chapter which I guest edited:

The relationship between video and the self has been one of the central concerns of video theory. Prominent artists such as Vito Acconci, Dan Graham, Joan Jonas, and Bruce Nauman have organized their artistic practice around mediated self-observation, either using video to document and complicate their own expressions of self or building installations with which viewers can see and experience themselves in new ways. Such self-portraiture is the subject of the most widely cited essay in this volume, Rosalind Krauss’s 1976 “Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism,” and of several essays responding to it.

Even before videotape became an artistic medium in 1965, though, video, self-observation, and narcissism were already the subjects of a theoretical literature produced by psychiatrists and psychologists. If patients saw how disordered they appeared to others, some psychotherapists suggested, they might be motivated to change. Other clinicians rewatched sessions with patients so that either could pause the video to discuss emotions or experiences which they hadn’t articulated, essentially putting themselves back into a moment in the conversation. Some of the most prominent artists and theorists working with video were directly influenced by this video therapy tradition.]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="technology" /><category term="media" /><category term="video" /><category term="cybernetics" /><category term="consciousness" /><category term="visual culture" /><category term="human sciences" /><category term="medicine" /><category term="art" /><category term="psychiatry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A chapter which I guest edited: The relationship between video and the self has been one of the central concerns of video theory.

In 1923, the Institute built the High Voltage Research Laboratory, now the Ronald and Maxine Lind Hall of Mathematics and Physics, with funding from Southern California Edison, which used the unique million-volt high-bay research facility to test high-voltage transmission equipment. Among Caltech's faculty, electrical engineer Royal Sorensen invented the cascade transformer for the facility, and physicist Robert Millikan planned to use its power to dismantle the atom and achieve the alchemists' dream of transmutation of matter.

Lauritsen and his students in turn modified their x-ray tubes to conduct research in nuclear physics, realizing Millikan's vision of deconstructing the atom. These three research programs built on each other, repurposing apparatus and thus ultimately the resources of the electricity industry to develop experimental physics in new directions.

Unfortunately, IBM and the Holocaust is generally regarded as hyperbolic and inaccurate by historians who research related subjects.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ready, Set, Spark</title><link href="https://collopy.net/writing/2020/ready-set-spark/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ready, Set, Spark" /><published>2020-08-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-08-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://collopy.net/writing/2020/ready-set-spark</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collopy.net/writing/2020/ready-set-spark/"><![CDATA[When Caltech's former Sloan Lab reopened in January 2019 as the Linde Hall of Mathematics and Physics, staff, faculty, and students encountered a structure with a transformed interior that was originally built 97 years ago.

The Alfred P. Sloan Laboratory for Mathematics and Physics became the Ronald and Maxine Linde Hall of Mathematics and Physics. Linde Hall occupies a structure which is now 97 years old and has evolved over that time with the disciplines of physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering.

The building, constructed in 1923, originally had a few names, including Edison High Tension Laboratory, High Voltage Research Laboratory, and High Potential Research Laboratory, but was generally referred to as High Volts. It was the fifth permanent building constructed on Caltech’s campus, after Throop Hall, Gates Laboratory of Chemistry, Culbertson Auditorium, and the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics.

Astrophysicist George Ellery Hale, as a Caltech trustee, conceived of the laboratory as part of a strategy of persuading experimentalist Robert Millikan to come to Caltech. Millikan was tortured—his word, not mine—by his decision of whether to come to Caltech or stay at the University of Chicago. Hale’s fellow trustees Henry M. Robinson and Arthur Fleming—both of whom became namesakes of buildings on campus—were also on the board of directors of the local electric company, Southern California Edison.

Hale proposed to them that if the Edison Company bought Caltech a new laboratory, both parties would benefit: “I believe the Company would get its money back in the form of new information regarding insulation and other problems connected with high voltage lines, not to speak of the advertising value.” He was right: The company's interest came from a decision they made around 1920 to change their transmission lines from 150,000 to 220,000 volts. Such lines and associated insulators, transformers, circuit breakers, and other equipment would need to be able to withstand a massive surge if they were struck by lightning, so the Edison Company wanted to conduct research at a million volts, a higher voltage than could be reliably produced by any existing American laboratory. The lab cost $139,915, of which Edison paid $105,000.

The design of High Volts was also a collaboration. Millikan provided specifications, including a requirement that the building have ventilation to allow ozone to escape but also not let in light. The interior was dominated by a single large industrial space packed with high-voltage apparatus, including two key pieces of million-volt equipment. A million-volt surge generator produced rapid impulses of artificial lightning. In addition, Royal Sorensen, who founded electrical engineering at Caltech when he was hired in 1910, invented the cascade transformer in 1922 (an innovation which was simultaneously made by others in Germany) and designed a million-volt model, composed of four 250,000 volt transformers built by Westinghouse which each weighed 22 tons, for High Volts; it stepped an externally-supplied 15,000 volts up to a million volts of continuous current. Edison engineers designed a steel frame, the second constructed in Pasadena, and prominent architect Bertram Goodhue designed the exterior, which used a diamond pattern to provide texture in the absence of windows. The similarly prominent architectural sculptor Lee Lawrie produced a relief over the entry which conveyed the high voltage research performed within.

Sorensen regularly gave a public lecture and demonstration on high voltage electricity, with the latter portion taking place in High Volts. “It proved to have its usual strong draw this year when, on a rainy Friday evening, almost 1000 people stormed East Bridge,” reported *Engineering and Science*, Caltech’s research magazine, in 1949. “Prof. Sorensen obligingly gave his lecture twice, and the lab ran off three demonstrations, while a special police detail coped with the crush.”

In [his oral history](http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechOH:OH_Roberts_J), Caltech chemistry professor John Roberts recalls visiting Caltech as a teenager for these demonstrations:

>The High Voltage Lab was a fabulous attraction. What is now the Sloan building then had no windows in it. It was deep down inside—just a great big basement-like room with no upper floors. And they had these big girders up at the top. The floor of this room was filled with all kinds of electrical equipment—enormous transformers, and condensers, and so on, big swooping insulators. It looked like Frankenstein’s laboratory. Great transformers topped with big mushroom rings, you know, they used to shoot sparks off of.… They’d have a “horn gap,” where a pair of wires would be close together at the top of the transformer and far apart at the top of the room. They would start an arc at the bottom and it would grow in length and rise to the ceiling. That was really impressive to watch as the arcs got up to the ceiling, and then crack, and disappear. They’d make this crackling noise as they’d go up. And then they’d charge up the condensers and shoot off big sparks, and blow up some blocks of wood, and stuff like that.

According to the February 1949 issue of *Engineering and Science*, “these facilities have been used to aid Southern California Edison in the development of high voltage transmission lines, to furnish lightning protection of oil storage tanks for the oil industry, to test insulators for numerous utility companies.” The transmission lines tested at High Volts made it possible to transmit electricity to Southern California from the Hoover Dam in Nevada. Among the significant inventions of the lab was a vacuum switch designed by Sorensen and Millikan which was manufactured for aircraft and other industries.

Going back to 1921, though, as Hale saw it in his letter to his fellow trustees, though, High Volts would have an entirely different benefit for the physicist he was trying to recruit. “Millikan,” he wrote, “would also have the advantage of using enormous voltage to bust up some of his atoms. This possibility, which no other laboratory could match, is what excites him.… When a man gets on the trail of the philosopher's stone, even if he isn't after gold, you can accomplish a great deal by offering it to him!”

Millikan's interest did indeed come from his interest in taking apart atoms and discovering what they were made of. He was also seeking, as Hale's reference to the philosopher's stone suggests, to transmute matter from one element to another by reconstructing the nucleus. In 1904, Millikan had already written that “the dreams of the ancient alchemists are true, for the radioactive elements all appear to be slowly but spontaneously transmuting themselves into other elements.” In 1912, he believed he and his student George Winchester produced hydrogen ions from aluminum using high-voltage electricity. In 1919, Ernest Rutherford persuaded more physicists that he had caused nitrogen atoms to eject protons by bombarding them with alpha particles. Several scientists claimed they had turned various metals into gold in the 1920s using electricity—it was a renaissance of alchemy.

Although Millikan submitted a grant proposal for support for this research in 1921, and although he, Hale, and Caltech as an institution occasionally referred to the High Voltage Laboratory as intended for investigations inside the atom, Millikan never published the results of his efforts to transmute matter at Caltech, nor can evidence of it be found in his surviving laboratory notebooks. In his article on the subject, historian Robert Kargon, suggests that “these efforts may have in fact been made but were unsuccessful,” adding that Millikan “preferred to bury quietly unfruitful enterprises; he position as fundraiser for an exciting new research center made such unpublicized interment a practical necessity.” Ultimately, then, the new lab would find other uses.

Charles Lauritsen, who received his PhD from Caltech in 1929 and remained here for the rest of his career, made High Volts a key site for high-voltage X-ray research, building the first million-volt X-ray tube there in about 1930. Lauritsen soon became interested in the medical applications of this device, writing in his patent application that “radiations substantially the frequency of the gamma radiation from radium may be obtained from the tube” and that “such tubes can therefore be employed as the full equivalent of radium in the treatment of disease, or for therapeutic purposes.”

Although Caltech biologists steered clear of medical applications at this time, its physicists did not. Millikan enlisted local physician Seeley G. Mudd, whose mother was already donating a geology building to the Institute in memory of his father, mining tycoon Seeley W. Mudd. That building is now typically called North Mudd, as the younger Mudd later donated an associated building named after himself as well, South Mudd. I for one didn't realize until I was preparing this talk that the two buildings are named after two different men.

To return to our story, Millikan enlisted the younger Mudd in a partnership researching the therapeutic effects of Lauritsen's million-volt x-ray tube compared to lower voltage radiation already available in hospitals, and the Los Angeles County General Hospital began to bring cancer patients to High Volts for radiation therapy. Although he was independently wealthy and didn't receive a salary, and indeed donated money as well as his time to the project, Caltech appointed Mudd became Research Associate in Radiation, and later, in 1935, Professor of X-Ray Therapy. Physician Clyde Emery was made Assistant Professor of X-Ray Therapy at the same time. Caltech's medical physics research was so active that it became one of the main reasons for the Institute to construct a new building, Kellogg Radiation Laboratory, in 1932.

Meanwhile, Lauritsen’s students, funded by their work maintaining x-ray tubes for radiation therapy, began modifying High Volts equipment for nuclear physics, making Millikan's vision of deconstructing the atom there a reality; H. Richard Crane, for example, produced neutrons by ion beam for the first time in the early 1930s. “The transmutation of the elements, now an accomplished fact,” wrote Millikan to their funder, W. K. Kellogg, “plus artificial radioactivity, plus neutron beams—all three effects producible by Lauritsen tubes—plus the manifold uses of ultra-short wireless waves, therapeutic and otherwise, open up endless opportunities.”

As with many research programs, radiation therapy came to an end at Caltech when funders—not only Kellogg but also the National Academy of Sciences’ National Cancer Advisory Council and the Childs Foundation, decided to stop funding it. In the early 1940s, Kellogg was dramatically repurposed for research on rocketry as the US prepared to enter World War II.

High Volts retained its unusual, single-room architecture until 1960, when Caltech renovated it into the Alfred P. Sloan Laboratory of Mathematics and Physics, producing a more conventional internal structure, with windows and five floors of space, including new basements, rather than a single large room. By this point, it had had a storied career contributing to electrical engineering, nuclear physics, radiation therapy, spectacular public demonstrations, and even science we might call alchemy.]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="presentations" /><category term="Caltech" /><category term="physics" /><category term="technology" /><category term="laboratories" /><category term="engineering" /><category term="science" /><category term="California" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Caltech rededicated a building on its campus following a major renovation.

Wilson.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Cybernetics Moment, or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age</title><link href="https://collopy.net/writing/2019/cybernetics-moment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Cybernetics Moment, or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age" /><published>2019-05-30T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://collopy.net/writing/2019/cybernetics-moment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collopy.net/writing/2019/cybernetics-moment/"><![CDATA[The historical literature on cybernetics has ballooned in the last 15 years, as scholars have sought to understand how scientists and engineers studying “control and communication in the animal and the machine” (as Norbert Weiner subtitled his book <cite>Cybernetics</cite>) contributed to Soviet and Chilean computer networks, assistive technologies for the deaf, theories of schizophrenia, and experimental music and cinema, to name just a few of their projects.

Absolutely! Technology of consciousness is a term I found in communications scholar Fred Turner’s work, particularly his essay on the composer Paul DeMarinis. Every technology affects how we think and experience the world, but I use this phrase specifically to refer to technologies whose users understood that they were doing so. The quintessential examples are psychedelic drugs, which people use specifically in order to alter their consciousness. For many videographers in the 1960s and 1970, video was like a drug in that it helped a person see the world in new ways; a cartoon in the magazine Radical Software proclaimed, for example, that “Video is as powerful as LSD.”]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="video" /><category term="consciousness" /><category term="visual culture" /><category term="analog/digital" /><category term="media" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were really struck by your description of early video as a technology of consciousness.

Technology plays an increasing role in our understandings of ourselves, our communities, and our societies, in how we think about politics and war, science and religion, work and play. Humans have made and used technologies, though, for thousands if not millions of years. In this course, we will use this history as a resource to understand how technologies affect social relations, and conversely how the culture of a society shapes the technologies it produces. Do different technologies produce or result from different economic systems like feudalism, capitalism, and communism? Can specific technologies promote democratic or authoritarian politics? Do they suggest or enforce different patterns of race, class, or gender relations? Among the technologies we'll consider will be large objects like cathedrals, bridges, and airplanes; small ones like guns, clocks, and birth control pills; and networks like the electrical grid, the highway system, and the internet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The course will meet on Tuesday evenings, 6:00 to 9:00, from September 2 to December 9 in Williams Hall room 219. It will be a discussion-based seminar, though I will punctuate it with occasional presentations. I will be available for office hours before class on Tuesdays from 5:00 to 6:00 in Claudia Cohen Hall room 332, and encourage you to come by and talk.</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>As a seminar, this course is primarily based on learning by discussing the required readings (listed below), so it’s essential that you <a href="reading">read and think about them</a> before each class meeting. Your engaged and insightful participation in discussions will account for 25% of your grade for the course.</p>
<p>The other assignments consist of three short papers, of approximately five pages each. I’ll provide more detailed prompts, but in short <a href="politics">the first paper</a> should present an argument about whether and how a particular technology “has politics,” <a href="observing">the second</a> should describe and analyze your observation of people using technology, and <a href="history">the third</a> should present a brief history of a technology of your choice.

Do they suggest or enforce different patterns of race, class, or gender relations?

Tools that had previously been available only in television studios turned up in art galleries, in psychiatric hospitals, and in the Black Panther Party. This cultural portability was facilitated by a material portability: the technology got smaller, it got cheaper, it got lighter. For instance, this 1970 Sony camera is part of a piece of equipment called a portapak. Between the camera and the deck it was a complete video production studio that was light enough for somebody to carry around and was battery-powered.

</p>

</p>

<p>
	Although it has a longer history, topic modeling is now typically done using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a hierarchical Bayesian model developed by computer scientist David Blei and his colleagues (<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf">initial article</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2009.pdf">technical description</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf">less technical description</a>). The premise, it’s worth stating explicitly, is a rather odd model of composition. “Documents are mixtures of topics,” explains <a href="http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/SteyversGriffithsLSABookFormatted.pdf">one article</a>, “where a topic is a probability distribution over words. A topic model is a generative model for documents: it specifies a simple probabilistic procedure by which documents can be generated. To make a new document, one chooses a distribution over topics. Then, for each word in that document, one chooses a topic at random according to this distribution, and draws a word from that topic. Standard statistical techniques can be used to invert this process, inferring the set of topics that were responsible for generating a collection of documents.” So topic modeling involves reverse engineering the creation of a text, which is conceptualized as a process of synthesizing multiple topics into a single document. As far as the computer can understand them, though, these “topics” are simply sets of words with associated frequencies. Because topics can be conceptualized as vectors, it is also relatively easy to measure correlations between words or correlations between topics.
</p>
<p>
	Among digital humanists, the most widely used tool for topic modeling is <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/">MALLET</a> (<a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet">tutorial</a>), “a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text.” There are several alternatives, though, including libraries for <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/">C</a>, <a href="http://arbylon.net/projects/">Java</a>, <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">Python</a>, <a href="http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/programs_data/toolbox.htm">Matlab</a>, and R (<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i13/">topicmodels</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lda">lda</a>) as well as two Java applications: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/">Topic Modeling Tool</a> provides a graphical interface for MALLET (<a href="http://miriamposner.com/blog/very-basic-strategies-for-interpreting-results-from-the-topic-modeling-tool/">tutorial</a>), while the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/tmt/tmt-0.4/">Stanford Modeling Toolbox</a> is scriptable using Scala  and processes CSV files. The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities has produced some <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/topic-modeling-round-up-and-some-new-software/">additional utilities</a> for MALLET. Perhaps the easiest tool available is the Zotero extension <a href="http://papermachines.org/">Paper Machines</a>, which incorporates MALLET. Paper Machines can model not only Zotero collections, but also JSTOR Data for Research CSV files, which otherwise requires <a href="http://www.jgoodwin.net/?p=1036">some preprocessing</a> to be legible to MALLET. Its output doesn’t seem very versatile, though.
</p>
<p>
	There are several precedents for tracking the rise and fall of topics over time, though few seem to have contributed to peer-reviewed historical articles. A project by historian Robert Nelson on the <a href="http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/">Richmond <cite>Daily Dispatch</cite></a> from 1860 to 1865, conducted using MALLET, produced a widely-cited web presentation, and computer scientist David Newman and historian Sharon Block conducted a similar study of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/pubs/JASIST_Newman.pdf"><cite>Pennsylvania Gazette</cite></a> from 1728 to 1800. (Block and Newman also published a historical article on <a href="muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/summary/v023/23.1.block.html">trends in the field of women’s history</a> from 1985 to 2005 for which they used topic modeling to compare the prominence of research topics, but its diachronic analysis is all based on text-mining.) Historian Cameron Belvins has diachronically topic modeled <a href="http://historying.org/2010/04/01/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/">Martha Ballard’s diary</a>. Among several studies of academic journals by computer scientists, David Mimno’s work on the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/publications/02-jocch-mimno.pdf">field of classics</a> stands out for its careful methodology.
</p>
<p>
	Perhaps the best model for using topic modeling in historical research is literature scholar Allen Riddell’s apparently unpublished paper on the <a href="http://ariddell.org/static/how-to-read-n-articles.pdf">history of German Studies</a>, which contains a particularly clear technical explanation as well as a study of the rise and fall of topics ranging from gender to Goethe. Similarly, but in published articles, folklorist John Laudun and literature scholar Jonathan Goodwin used topic modeling to illuminate the dynamics of <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_american_folklore/v126/126.502.laudun.html">folklore studies’ turn toward performance</a>, while Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood not only modeled the <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/what-can-topic-models-of-pmla-teach-us-by-ted-underwood-and-andrew-goldstone/">topics of the <cite>Proceedings of the Modern Language Association</cite></a>, but also produced network visualizations of the relationships between the topics.
</p>
<p>
	It is also possible to produce models in which  topics themselves evolve over time, changing their word composition. As a demonstration of <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2006a.pdf">dynamic topic models</a>, Blei and fellow computer scientist John Lafferty produced a <a href="http://topics.cs.princeton.edu/Science/">browsable year-by-year model of <cite>Science</cite></a>. Blei has also published, with computer scientist Sean M. Gerrish, a study attempting to use such models to <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/GerrishBlei2010.pdf">measure the influence of scientific publications</a> without resort to citations or other conventional bibliometric tools. Similarly, computer scientists Xuerui Wang and Andrew McCallum (the latter the initial developer of MALLET) developed a model called <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/tot-kdd06.pdf">Topics over Time</a>, which they tested on Presidential State of the Union Addresses and proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems conference. Very few humanists—possibly only Laudun and Goodwin—have used these tools.

	On January 11, autodidact, hacker, and activist <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a> committed suicide in the midst of a draconian prosecution for using guest access to MIT’s network to download millions of articles from JSTOR. I’d only had a few brief conversations with Aaron on Twitter, but I read his blog for almost a decade, making his projects and ideas a steady presence in my life. In the words of Grace Llewellyn’s <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2674846W/The_Teenage_Liberation_Handbook"><cite>Teenage Liberation Handbook</cite></a>, for which Aaron and I <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">shared an affection</a> as unschoolers, Aaron was a “glorious generalist,” someone who has deep interests but, rather than obsessing, searches for connections between them and everything else. The world needs such people. I was crushed by Aaron’s death.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
	On Tuesday, MIT released its review panel’s report on “<a href="http://swartz-report.mit.edu/docs/report-to-the-president.pdf">MIT and the Prosecution of Aaron Swartz</a>.” Those of us interested in the case have been anticipating this report, particularly given the respect many of us have for computer scientist <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/">Hal Abelson</a>, who was charged by MIT’s president with writing it. Personally, I learned how to program when I was about ten from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/logo-macintosh">a book by Abelson and his daughter</a>, and still appreciate his approach to computer science pedagogy and work with foundations like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and the <a href="http://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The Abelson report effectively depicts an MIT administration telling itself it was neutral in the case while cooperating with the prosecution, particularly by allowing prosecutors to repeatedly meet with witnesses without an MIT lawyer present once MIT had granted them initial permission, a courtesy they did not extend to the defense. It depicts an MIT that didn’t see itself as Aaron’s victim, but also never recognized its own role as legislator given the use of the <a href="http://ist.mit.edu/network/rules">MITNet Rules of Use</a> to support a claim, under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>, that Aaron exceeded authorized access to MIT’s network. Within MIT, only incoming Media Lab director <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a> suggested that MIT question the premise of the prosecution, writing to MIT’s lawyers that “since it is a criminal case and the prosecutor needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was unauthorized, I think MIT is in the position to ‘cast doubt’ if it desires.” As defense attorneys asked MIT to speak out against the prosecution with increasing urgency, the Institute’s main reason for not doing so seems to have been that they believed it might actually hurt Aaron’s case, that they believed—as Aaron’s friend <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">Lawrence Lessig wrote</a> immediately after Aaron’s death—that prosecutor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Heymann">Stephen Heymann</a> was a bully who interpreted opposition as a personal attack on his authority and responded by escalating.
</p>
<p>
	The report is nonetheless a disappointment. I don’t think I saw until now MIT President L. Rafael Reif’s formal letter to Abelson requesting the report, and I certainly hadn’t realized that Abelson’s charge was limited to fact-finding and “identify[ing] the issues that warrant further analysis in order to learn from these events.” Since Abelson and his colleagues on the review panel, economist <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/pdiamond">Peter Diamond</a> and lawyer <a href="http://grossolaw.com/grosso.htm">Andrew Grosso</a>, didn’t discover any shocking malfeasance on the part of MIT, their recommendations (which take the form of questions to avoid exceeding their charge) are rather mundane, including reforming MIT’s data retention policies and holding “a series of campus-wide deliberations around issues raised by this report.” The most critical, perhaps, is that MIT “develop additional on-campus expertise for handling potential computer crime incidents” in order to avoid reliance on outside police, reliance that in Aaron’s case inadvertently (from MIT’s perspective) involved the Secret Service.
</p>
<p>
	This limited charge proscribed the review panel from asserting outright that MIT should have behaved differently. The two quotations from their interviews which they include in their conclusion, though, say a lot. One administrator told the review panel, “MIT didn’t do anything wrong, but we didn’t do ourselves proud.” And a friend of Aaron’s pointed out that “neutrality on these cases is an incoherent stance. It’s not the right choice for a tough leader or a moral leader.”

	Early this summer, I taught <a href="/teaching/2013/cyberculture/">a course</a> on the history and culture of the internet. In our discussion of Lessig’s book <a href="http://codev2.cc/"><cite>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</cite></a>, I suggested to students that it, like most political writing, was written in the genre of advice for those in power. Its central point is that “cyberspace requires choices” in how it is built, both by programmers and by legislators. Lessig’s message to these influential people was that although their decisions might seem merely technical, they are in fact deeply ethical. Although he was quite pessimistic that those in power would rise to the occasion—“we urgently need to make fundamental choices about values,” wrote Lessig, “but… the government we have now is a failure”—he wrote a book about how governance on the internet ought to function in America.
</p>
<p>
	I also showed my class Aaron’s 2012 Freedom to Connect keynote speech, “<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/1/14/freedom_to_connect_aaron_swartz_1986">How We Stopped SOPA</a>,” and noted a difference in perspective between these two political documents. Aaron’s intended audience was those who are not in power. His message was that they too should seek to influence internet policy, and indeed that this is the way out of Lessig’s trap. “We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story,” concluded Aaron. “Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom. They threw themselves into it. They did whatever they could think of to do. They didn’t stop to ask anyone for permission.… The internet really is out of control.”
</p>
<p>
	Internet censorship was an issue on which Swartz and Lessig generally agreed, but their rhetoric appealed to different audiences: to caricature a bit, Lessig’s was technocratic while Swartz’s was rabble-rousing. The lesson I suggested to my students was not that Aaron’s perspective was more productive than Lessig’s; I love Lessig’s critical edge, and since I teach at the University of Pennsylvania, I expect that some of my students will become influential politicians and programmers who may build the internet more humanely under Lessig’s influence. Rather, I suggested that, in considering any political issue, it’s worth thinking through both perspectives. What could you do to improve the world in a particular way if you were in a position of authority? What could you do if you were not? We need to be able to think in both ways because most of us move back and forth between these situations over the course of our lives and even over the course of our days. I, for example, have no more influence than my neighbors in electoral politics, but make hiring and firing decisions as a board member of our local food co-op. In either context, though, I want to act ethically.</p>
<p>
	Because they were not in the role of either prosecutor or defendant, and because Aaron was not formally affiliated with the Institute, MIT’s lawyers and administrators imagined themselves to be neutral, without any ethical interest in the prosecution. The Abelson report reveals that they acted properly, for the most part, with regard to their professional and legal responsibilities. Their largest sins of commission were relatively minor, permitting the prosecutors greater access to witnesses than the defense team and acting on a subpoena which had apparently expired. It also reveals, though, that they failed—“<a href="http://tarensk.tumblr.com/post/56881327662/mit-report-is-a-whitewash-my-statement-in-response">reprehensibly</a>,” as Aaron’s partner Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman writes, “<a href="https://archives.lessig.org/index6f09.html">more than negligent[ly]</a>,” as Lessig writes—to act on their deeper ethical responsibilities, in particular by not asserting that Aaron hadn’t actually violated their Rules of Use. In short, MIT believed that as long as they played their narrow role in the drama everything would turn out fine; they did not “take it as their job,” as Aaron would have counseled, to consider whether the prosecutor was behaving ethically and how they could influence him. Given that the case concerned not only the use of MIT property, and not only issues of intellectual and practical interest to many MIT students and faculty, but the eminent possibility of a ruined life, this was a grave ethical failure.

The course might also be called “Several Ways of Looking at the Internet,” “Histories and Cultures of the Internet,” or “Introduction to Internet Studies.” In this course, we will explore how people use the internet to develop new conceptions of identity, build virtual communities, and affect political change. Each class we’ll study an aspect of the history and culture of the internet, covering topics such as hackers, virtuality, sovereignty, and algorithms. We’ll read books, articles, and blogs about historical and contemporary cultures of computing, from Spacewar players and phone phreaks in the 1970s to Google, Facebook, World of Warcraft, WikiLeaks, and Anonymous today. In addition, we’ll explore some of these online communities and projects ourselves, and develop our own analyses of them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The course will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:00 to 4:10, from May 21 to June 27 in Claudia Cohen Hall room 392. It will be a discussion-based seminar, though I will punctuate it with occasional presentations. I will be available for office hours before class on Thursdays from 12:00 to 1:00 in Claudia Cohen Hall room 332, and encourage you to come by and talk.</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>As a seminar, this course is primarily based on learning by discussing the required readings (listed below), so it’s essential that you read and think about them before each class meeting.</p>

<p>The main component of this course other than discussions is a final project, which will involve developing your own analysis of an online community or phenomenon incorporating some ways of looking at the internet from the course. Such a project could take the form of a traditional research paper of 10–15 pages or an online presentation involving a similar amount of research and analysis; possibilities range from videos and webcomics to Twitter or Tumblr experiments and beyond. Although you are not required to make your project publicly available online, I can suggest from my own experience that it can be more exciting to produce for an audience beyond your instructor and would be happy to talk with you about appropriate online venues for sharing your project.</p>

<p>In order to help you progress toward completing your project over the course of the semester, I will ask that you meet with me to discuss your ideas for your project on May 28 or 30, submit a short (one to three page) proposal by June 6, present a progress report to the class June 11 or 13, submit a draft to me by June 20, and submit the final project on June 27, the last day of class. I will provide feedback at each of these stages. Your grade for the course will be based 20% on your proposal, 20% on your presentation, 30% on your final project, and 30% on your engaged and insightful participation in discussions.</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<p>One of the things we’ll do in this course is use recent history to find ways to think about current events. Accordingly, you may find it interesting or useful for your project to follow some news. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/"><cite>The Atlantic</cite>’s technology channel</a> is among the best sources. <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><cite>Wired</cite></a> has many sections and blogs of varying quality, and their security blog <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/">Threat Level</a> is particularly good.</p>

	<p>The best source for cyberculture news might be Twitter, though, provided you follow the right people. My account is <a href="http://twitter.com/collopy">@collopy</a>, and I’ve made a list of <a href="http://twitter.com/collopy/cyberculture/">some Twitter users relevant to this course</a> that you can subscribe to, including the authors of texts on this syllabus. If you find anything online you’d like to share with the class, please tweet it using the (admittedly silly) hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23cyberpenn">#cyberpenn</a>.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Please find a list of required readings below. Many readings are freely available online (and linked here), and I will make most of the others available to students. The exception is <cite>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</cite> by Fred Turner, the one book we’ll be reading in its entirety, which is available for sale at the Penn Book Center and for borrowing at Van Pelt Library’s Rosengarten Reserve Room. Other books are also available at the Penn Book Center for those who would like to own them.</p>

They’ve got two million members, you bring three million to the next meeting, call a vote. ‘All those in favor of tossing guns?’ Bam. Move on.”</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Skinner isn’t exactly proposing direct action, but the president’s staff on <cite>The West Wing</cite> clearly consider this sort of activist politics beneath them. Josh is dismissive not, it seems to me, because it’s a bad idea, but simply because it’s not the way establishment liberals do things. “It’s a heck of a strategy, Matt,” he says. “I’ll bring that up at a meeting.”</p>

<p>As American started talking seriously about gun control in the weeks after December’s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, this scene played over and over in my head. What if a lobbying organization like the National Rifle Association could be made responsive to the public—or at least to those who care enough about its issue to join whether they agree with its current political stances or not? At the very least, this fictional congressman had a more creative approach to gun control activism than the ineffective assault weapons bans championed by many Democratic legislators.</p>

<p>If the NRA is any kind of democracy, it’s representative rather than direct, so I started looking into how the NRA’s Board of Directors is elected. While the Association’s policies regarding elections aren’t available online, you can find blogs where members gripe about the system’s shortcomings and occasionally describe it in some detail. I was intrigued enough to write to the NRA and ask for a copy of their bylaws, which they were kind enough to mail me.</p>

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" title="Envelope from the NRA" src="/images/envelope.gif" width="357" height="243">

<p>My conclusion is that Skinner’s idea wouldn’t work. Even if you could persuade three million—or five million, or ten million—progressives to join the NRA, the organization’s bylaws ensure they couldn’t take it over. Aaron Sorkin frequently says <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/aaron-sorkin-newsroom-interview.html">in interviews</a> he can “write about people who are smarter than I am and know more than I do, and I am able to do that simply by being tutored almost phonetically, sometimes.” Much of what passes for intelligence among his characters is merely cleverness. It would not be difficult for an actual Republican congressman to understand that the NRA can resist conquest by “gun control people.” For the rest of us, however, here’s how it works:</p>

<img title="The National Rifle Association of America Bylaws" src="/images/bylaws.gif" style="display: block; float: right; margin: 10px;" width="175" height="375">

<p>In addition to a fairly typical clause offering membership only to those “who subscribe… to the objectives and purposes of the Association,” the bylaws bar new members from voting unless they purchase a “Life Membership,” <a href="https://membership.nrahq.org/forms/signup.asp">currently available for $1000</a>. Article III, section 6, item e, part 1 states that only “lifetime members and annual members with five or more consecutive years of membership… who have attained the age of 18 years and who are citizens of the United States of American shall be entitled to a vote” when electing Directors.</p>

<p>The bylaws also prescribe the process by which aspiring Directors of the NRA get their names on the ballot. Most are nominated by a Nominating Committee (on which <cite>Mother Jones</cite> journalist Frank Smyth has <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/nra-board-newtown-bushmaster">some interesting reporting</a>) appointed by the Board of Directors and thus unlikely to rock the boat. Alternately, a candidate may be placed on the ballot by a petition of a mere 250 signatures of members eligible to vote.</p>

<p><a href="http://firearmscoalition.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=599">According to NRA member Jeff Knox</a>, this petition process was instituted in 1977 as part of “a major member revolt at the annual meeting in Cincinnati [in which] a more politically aggressive faction grabbed the reigns of the organization.” <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/172125/how-nra-became-organization-aspiring-vigilantes-part-2">As Rick Perlstein writes</a>, it was in this coup that the NRA became more concerned with opposing gun control than with outdoor sports. Making the NRA more democratic by introducing petitions was a way to keep it accountable to a politically involved membership.</p>

<p>Now, though, the NRA’s membership is in favor of substantially more gun control than their leadership, even if it isn’t flooded with three million “gun control people”; <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1300512">74% of NRA members support background checks for all gun purchases</a>. There are a number of reasons why the NRA’s leadership doesn’t reflect membership opinion, but among them is surely that, according to Knox and other members, only 7% of eligible members vote. (This number is probably low, since <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/01/nra-membership-numbers">it’s likely that many of the NRA’s Life Members are dead</a>, but it’s still probable that only a minority of eligible members vote.) The shortest path to the NRA becoming a more moderate organization might be simply for moderates to run for the Board of Directors—by petition if necessary—and for other moderates to vote for them. The “hardliners” who made the NRA what it is today may have also left a way out.</p>]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="politics" /><category term="technology" /><category term="technopolitics" /><category term="conservatism" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an episode of The West Wing—“The Portland Trip”—in which Republican congressman Matt Skinner quips to presidential aide Josh Lyman, “I never understood why you gun control people don’t all join the NRA.

Portable video recorders like the <a href="http://experimentaltvcenter.org/sony-av-3400-porta-pak">Sony AV-3400</a>—universally known to users as “portapaks”—brought video out of the television studio and into both the artist&#8217;s studio and the streets, where they were used to document political activism, countercultural exuberance, and everyday life. This is the moment curator Lori Zippay captures in <a href="http://diabeacon.org/exhibitions/main/118"><cite>Circa 1971: Early Video &#038; Film from the EAI Archives</cite></a>, an exhibit drawn on the collections of <a href="http://eai.org/">Electronic Arts Intermix</a> on display at <a href="http://diabeacon.org/">Dia:Beacon</a> through December 31.</p>

<p><a href="http://diabeacon.org/exhibitions/page/118/1665">As Zippay writes</a>, “performance and visual artists, political activists, cybernetic theorists, filmmakers, <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10457">Fluxus</a> provocateurs, and self-described video freaks and electronic geeks all contributed to the fluid mix—and creative friction—of the emergent video art scene.” She portrays this diversity of early video by bringing together 15 video productions and eight related films from 1970, 1971, and 1972. This tight periodization means the show, like an archaeological dig site, reveals a single stratum of video&#8217;s early history rather than a chronology of video art.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Mayday Realtime" src="/images/mayday.jpg" width="367" height="205">
<p>The most fascinating works are those sometimes described as video verité, which provide glimpses into an unrehearsed past. In <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/mayday-realtime"><cite>Mayday Realtime</cite></a>, for example, <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=370">David Cort</a> walks and drives around Washington, D.C. on <a href="http://libcom.org/library/ending-war-inventing-movement-mayday-1971">May Day 1971</a>, documenting antiwar demonstrations and the police response. Cort, founder of a video collective called the <a href="http://videofreex.com/">Videofreex</a> who lived in a communal house in the Catskills, consistently turned up with a camera at countercultural events like the <a href="http://bethelwoodscenter.org/museum/festivalhistory.aspx">Woodstock Festival</a> and the <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chicago7/chicago7.html">Chicago Seven trial</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://projectshirley.com/bio.html">Shirley Clarke</a>’s <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=5912">	<cite>The Tee Pee Video Space Troupe: The First Years</cite></a> portrays cultural moments both more mundane and more glamorous than Cort’s May Day. In one segment, Clarke carouses with John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and Andy Warhol. “Video gives me something to do at parties,” Clarke tells the audience with an intertitle. Like many other videographers, Clarke—already an Academy Award winning filmmaker—was fascinated by the unique features of the video medium. As she tells a silent, posing Ono, her camera recorded sound, as film cameras could not. (Recording sound for film requires separate recording equipment.)</p>
<p>In the second segment of <cite>The Tee Pee Video Space Troupe</cite>, Shirley Clarke and Arthur C. Clarke—no relation—experiment with the interactions between two new gadgets. The science fiction writer points a laser at the filmmaker’s video camera, producing beautiful “sunbursts” and kaleidoscopic images. She has set up monitors displaying the video being recorded, so he watches himself and the abstractions he produces in real time, a mirroring practice characteristic of experimental video.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Vertical Roll" src="/images/jonas_vertical_web.jpg" width="250" height="188">
<p>Indeed, many of the more explicitly artistic videos in <cite>Circa 1971</cite> are subversive self-portraits. <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=408">Joan Jonas</a>’ <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/vertical-roll">	<cite>Vertical Roll</cite></a> consists of sensual explorations of the artist’s body interrupted by the vertical rolling characteristic of a poorly calibrated CRT television in time to a violent clanging sound. This disruption of the viewing experience challenges viewers to question the routine objectification of women’s bodies. Similarly, in <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/i-am-making-art"><cite>I Am Making Art</cite></a> <a href="http://baldessari.org/">John Baldessari</a> challenges the category of art itself by incessantly repeating the titular phrase while moving through the video frame.</p>
<p>As Zippay notes in her essay, these pieces convey “an analog—that is, slowed-down—experience of time” compared to that of 2012. The sparse arrangement of the self portraits—displayed on large video monitors set along the wall of the gallery like paintings, with no seating—compounds this sense of slowness. Since each of six is around 20 minutes long, I found myself circulating among them, returning to those I’d already watched for a few minutes to see how the artists were doing.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="Self-Portraits" src="/images/11_09_circa_image04.jpg" width="400" height="267">
<p>Experimental videographers generally embraced the ability to record continuously afforded by cheap tape—which, if you ran out, could also be recorded over. The ideal of cinema without editing pioneered by Warhol on film (and at least once on video) became common among videographers, and is evidenced here both by documentary works like <cite>Mayday Realtime</cite> and consciously artistic ones like <cite>I Am Making Art</cite>. It was often in editing, though, that experimental video most effectively demonstrated its emotional range.</p>
<p>In a series of <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=2991">	<cite>Media Primers</cite></a>, three members of the video collective <a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/e/history.html">Raindance</a> edited together segments from their diverse tape collection. I was particularly struck by <a href="http://ira-schneider.com/artist/">Ira Schneider</a>’s contribution, perhaps the least cerebral of the three, in which a hippie playing guitar and singing euphorically is intercut with footage of a campaign event for Richard Nixon and scuffles in the audience at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert">Altamont</a>.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" title="TV Cello Premiere" src="/images/11_09_circa_image02.jpg" width="400" height="267">
<p><cite>Circa 1971</cite> also includes a handful of short films from the era, which are projected rather than displayed on CRTs. <a href="http://eai.org/title.htm?id=13739">	<cite>TV Cello Premiere</cite></a> by <a href="http://paikstudios.com/">Nam June Paik</a> and <a href="http://hamsadesign.com/vidfilm/JudYalkut.html">Jud Yalkut</a>, shown at the exhibit’s entrance, depicts one of Paik’s collaborations with <a href="http://eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=344">Charlotte Moorman</a>. The cellist played a one-stringed cello constructed by Paik, <a href="http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/881">	<cite>TV Cello</cite></a>, which displayed the performance, other cellists, and broadcast television on its three TV screens.</p>
<p>Many of the works in <cite>Circa 1971</cite>, most notably <cite>TV Cello Premiere</cite> and <cite>Vertical Roll</cite>,  reveal particular technical features of the video technology used to create them. This is not the technology on which they’re displayed, however; despite being about analog media, <cite>Circa 1971</cite> is an exhibit of digital reproductions. Given the fragility and glitchiness of analog video, such concessions to practicality are necessary to display this work, but they leave the analog video medium itself absent from the gallery. An exhibit which more fully portrayed analog video as both a technology and an artistic medium might feature a portapak on a pedestal in the center of the gallery, surrounded by the art it helped create.</p>

Its effects can also be seen in the media, as in misplaced enthusiasm about the role of Twitter in the Iranian uprising of 2009. Foundational to Morozov’s portrayal is Andrew Sullivan’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/06/the-revolution-will-be-twittered/200478/">announcement on his blog</a> that Iranians began communicating using Twitter after the government shut down the cell phone network. “That a new information technology could be improvised for this purpose so swiftly is a sign of the times,” wrote Sullivan. “You cannot stop people any longer. You cannot control them any longer. They can bypass your established media; they can broadcast to one another; they can organize as never before.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Intriguingly, Morozov traces cyber-utopianism to “former hippies’” attempts “to prove that the Internet could deliver what the 1960s couldn’t: boost democratic participation, trigger a renaissance of moribund communities, strengthen associational life, and serve as a bridge from bowling alone to blogging together.” Morozov is right that the counterculture had some influence on the cyber-utopianism of today, but it’s perhaps deeper than he acknowledges. Hippies did not wait for the emergence of the internet to embrace the vision of a networked society; rather, the countercultural politics of the 1960s already incorporated a belief in the democratizing power of decentralized, electronic media. Indeed, despite Sullivan’s suggestion that the people’s power is unprecedented, one can find rhetoric virtually identical to his decades earlier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Portapak" src="/images/portapak.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="250"/></p>
<p>The focus of this earlier cyber-utopianism was on breaking the oligopoly of broadcast television with cable television, satellites, and other new electronic technologies. Central to this vision was a portable device designed, like the cell phone, for an individual user: Sony’s VideoRover II, released in 1968. This portapak, as users called it, was much lighter and less imposing than traditional television cameras. From the beginning, users interpreted it as a new medium for artistic and political expression. In his 1972 memoir <cite><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4116949W/The_Stoned_Apocalypse">The Stoned Apocalypse</a></cite>, spiritual seeker and prolific erotica writer Marco Vassi anticipated Sullivan by 37 years: “The enthusiasm for videotape,” he wrote, “came from the evenings we spent using the equipment with each other, to create portraits, and modes of psychological insight, and sheer technological art. I suppose we all had our first flashes of power through those sessions, the realization that if one had access to the technology, he had as strong a voice in shaping the destiny of the world as the politicians and generals.” Many also saw video as an inherently democratic technology that would distribute this power to be heard more equitably.</p>
<p>This ideology was most fully elaborated by the video collective <a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/e/history.html">Raindance</a>, particularly in Michael Shamberg’s 1971 book <cite><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL7098564W/Guerrilla_television">Guerrilla Television</a></cite>. Shamberg, who went on to become a Hollywood producer, presented television itself as a revolutionary technology which had already created a new “electronic environment,” “Media-America.” He was a technological determinist who believed that society was structured by its media; politics was mere superstructure which would follow automatically. “It’s nostalgia,” he wrote, “to think that… balance can be restored politically when politics are a function of Media-America, not vice-versa. Only through a radical re-design of its information structures to incorporate two-way, decentralized inputs can Media-America optimize the feedback it needs to come back to its senses.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Media-America" src="/images/media-america.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="250"/></p>
<p>Shamberg’s influences are evident even in this short quotation. Foremost among them was media theorist <a href="http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/">Marshall McLuhan</a>, who proposed that electronic media were creating a new social environment for humanity, a highly participatory “global village.” McLuhan&#8217;s research assistant <a href="http://earthscore.org/about.html">Paul Ryan</a> (no relation to the politician) was an experimental videographer who associated with Raindance; it was Ryan who developed the metaphor Shamberg employed of videography as guerrilla warfare in <a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/volume1nr3/pdf/VOLUME1NR3_art01.pdf">an article</a> in Raindance’s magazine <cite><a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/e/">Radical Software</a></cite>. Both McLuhan and Ryan were in turn deeply influenced by the Jesuit paleontologist and mystic <a href="http://teilharddechardin.org/biography.html">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</a>, particularly his interpretation of human communication as constituting a global mind or “noosphere.” A more effective noosphere—a “videophere,” in art critic <a href="http://geneyoungblood.com/">Gene Youngblood</a>’s terminology—became the political ideal of experimental videography.</p>
<p>More concretely, Shamberg believed that video would revolutionize particular social relations. “Going out to the suburbs with video cameras and taping commuters,” for example, could show them “how wasted they look from buying the suburban myth.” Being videotaped could sensitize police and prevent brutality. Shamberg’s technological optimism focused specifically on communication technology, as he saw new forms of television and other media as both the sources of social change and the proper replacements for an obsolete political sphere.</p>
<p>There were also those who warned against seeing video as a source of social change, though. Among them was Vassi, himself a founding member of Raindance. “There is some talk, and there will be more, in so-called underground tape circles about the revolutionary impact of tape,” <a href="http://radicalsoftware.org/volume1nr1/pdf/VOLUME1NR1_0020.pdf">wrote Vassi</a> in <cite>Radical Software</cite>. “I think it’s too late for all that. Every innovation in technology brought about by heads will be used by the power-trip neanderthals to furnish a more sophisticated 1984.… I think the thing to watch out for is this: That there be as little talking about all this as possible, not to keep the enemy from overhearing or any of that nonsense, but to guard against coming to believe one’s own rhetoric.”</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the recent past. In January 2010, a few months after the Iranian uprising, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a speech, “<a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm">Remarks on Internet Freedom</a>,” at the Newseum in Washington. “The spread of information networks is forming a new nervous system for our planet,” she told her audience. “When something happens in Haiti or Hunan, the rest of us learn about it in real time—from real people.” Clinton invoked the same emphasis on direct communication—media without mediation—which Shamberg celebrated in video and Sullivan in Twitter, and the same notion of a global mind which McLuhan and Ryan found in Teilhard. ”Now, in many respects, information has never been so free,” Clinton continued, agreeing with countercultural entrepreneur <a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/">Stewart Brand</a>, who declared in 1984 that “information wants to be free.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Hillary Clinson" src="/images/clinton.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="200"/></p>
<p>Clinton’s optimism was tempered, though. “We must also recognize that these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing,” she continued. “These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights.” Beyond that, we should heed Vassi’s warning and recognize the threat that we will be seduced by our tools and their false but persistent promise of revolutionary change without our active political effort. These information technologies can contribute to the success of political movements, but not if their users see them as replacements for political life.</p>]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="computing" /><category term="internet" /><category term="video" /><category term="technology" /><category term="technopolitics" /><category term="utopianism" /><category term="politics" /><category term="liberalism" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his 2011 book The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom, Evgeny Morozov defines cyber-utopianism as “a naîve belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn refusal to acknowledge its downside.” This belief, he writes, has entered U.S. foreign policy through the State Department’s internet freedom agenda.

	The LRAD, or Long Range Acoustic Device, is an extremely loud speaker—loud enough to damage hearing—that is <a href="http://www.lradx.com/site/">marketed</a> to militaries and police forces for both communication and “escalation of force.” It was <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5369190/lrad-sound-cannon-used-on-pittsburgh-g20-protesters">first deployed in the United States</a> at the Pittsburgh G20 protests in 2009 and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/05/14/chicago_cops_new_weapon/singleton/">will likely again</a> project orders and siren sounds this weekend in Chicago during demonstrations prompted by NATO’s summit meeting. It also embodies a logic which has pervaded American thought since World War II, a logic which conflates communication and control.

<p>
	As Aaron Bady <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/hearing-like-an-lrad/">points out</a>, the LRAD brings together violence and speech. “To ask the question of whether an LRAD is designed to hurt people or designed to communicate across long distances with people,” writes Bady, “is to mystify its central design function: It is a technology whose purpose is to FORCE you to listen and obey, and one which is less interested in the difference than you’d think.” The LRAD makes it impossible to think of policing—particularly the iconic “order to disperse” delivered to political demonstrators from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair#Bombing_and_gunfire">Chicago in 1886</a> to Pittsburgh in 2009 (shown above)—as a process in which orders come first and force follows only in the case of disobedience. The medium through which orders are communicated is itself forceful; the LRAD is a <em>weapon</em>, which is why the LRAD Corporation sells it, according to their <a href="http://www.lradx.com/site/content/view/323">fact sheet</a>, “only to qualified government agencies and commercial entities that are fully trained in the device’s operation.” Bady concludes, then, that the LRAD demonstrates policing is “simply about power. Communication is a means of making you obey,” and, from the perspective of the LRAD, nothing more.
</p>
<p>
	The LRAD conflates communication and force not only conceptually but materially: The same sound serves both purposes. It thus taps into a deep seam in twentieth century science and philosophy that is concerned precisely with the relationship between communication and action. It could be interpreted, for instance, in terms of <a href="http://online.sfsu.edu/~kbach/spchacts.html">speech act theory</a>: A loud LRAD order to disperse is both a threatening speech act and itself an act of force.
</p>
<p>
	Since the use of violence to establish control is intrinsic to the LRAD, though, its collapsing of communication and force resonates less with speech acts than the mid-century science of cybernetics. As MIT mathematician Norbert Wiener subtitled <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL14113345M/Cybernetics_or_Control_and_communication_in_the_animal_and_the_machine.">his 1948 book</a> in which he named the discipline, cybernetics involved the study of “control and communication in the animal and machine.” The field developed in the late 1940s through collaborations between scientists interested in understanding minds, societies, and machines in the same terms—collaborations such as the <a href="http://asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/history/MacySummary.htm">Macy Conferences</a>—and cyberneticians conflated control and communication in part to establish parallels between these different entities. This collapsing of categories also owed something, though, to the origins of cybernetics in military research.
</p>
<p>
	Wiener did much of his thinking about analogies between humans and mechanical control systems during World War II while designing an “antiaircraft predictor,” designed to aim a gun in order to shoot down a maneuvering plane. Such a predictor was necessary because during the twenty seconds a shell took to reach its target, the pilot would maneuver, apparently unpredictably. In his article “<a href="http://jerome-segal.de/Galison94.pdf">The Ontology of the Enemy: Norbert Wiener and the Cybernetic Vision</a>” and a <a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/12/najafi2.php">followup interview</a> in <cite>Cabinet</cite>, historian of science <a href="https://galison.scholar.harvard.edu">Peter Galison</a> argues that Wiener conceived of the enemy pilot as essentially mechanical, and his predictor as a machine that mirrored its behavior. “With no access to anything in the enemy plane,” he says, “Wiener simply treated the pilot-plane assembly as a complex machine—a servomechanism—that once characterized could be simulated in order to predict what it would do. And then it could be blown out of the sky.”
</p>
<p>
	Although Wiener’s work stood in a long tradition of <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8396574W/Between_Human_and_Machine">control engineering</a>—since his goal was simply to control a gun—his system also relied on interpreting the plane’s motions as communication to the predictor, which then “learned” its patterns by observing with radar. Even though, “because of the antagonistic relationship between attacker and defender, the anti-aircraft operator was obviously in no position to talk to or even see the pilot,” the latter’s movements still revealed—communicated—his intentions. From Wiener’s perspective as an engineer, though, there was no distinction between control and communication in this system; both were simply messages. There were messages conveyed by the pilot to the plane (through a joystick, say), from the plane to the predictor (through radar), from the predictor to the gun (through a mechanical connection), and from the gun to the plane (through a shell), but each relationship was one of both control and communication, of both force and speech.
</p>
<p>
	The U.S. military also embraced this conflation. During the decades after World War II “command and control,” previously two competing models of military management, became a single practice. <em>Command</em> traditionally involved an officer giving an order which was then interpreted and implemented by those below him in a hierarchy, often as more specific commands to their subordinates. It involved the ambiguity we expect from human communication, if not the dialogue. <em>Control</em>, on the other hand, was direct and (at least ideally) unambiguous. Nuclear weapons, which had to be deployed rapidly and only upon the decision of senior commanders, were subject to control rather than command. This distinction collapsed, though, as nuclear weapons were integrated into conventional military tactics. “By the early 1960s,” writes historian of technology <a href="http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/">Paul Edwards</a> in <cite><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2937046W/The_Closed_World">The Closed World</a></cite>, “military parlance treated the two as virtually identical. A decade later, ‘command, control, communications, and information’ (C<sup>3</sup>I) had become a single unified process.”
</p>
<p>
	It is from this postwar military ideology that the LRAD and its inventor Elwood Norris emerged. According to <a href="http://keynotespeakers.com/speaker_detail.php?speakerid=4074">his speaking bio</a>, Norris served in the Air Force as a nuclear weapons specialist in the 1950s before becoming an independent inventor. He was <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/06/smallbusiness/killer_sounds.fsb/">hired by the Navy</a> to design the LRAD in 2000 after the U.S.S. Cole bombing, and the original purpose of the device was to deter guerrillas from U.S. warships. It has since been used to deter Somali pirates from commercial ships and “to blast a series of Arabic phrases, such as ‘Go away or we will kill you,’” in Baghdad and Fallujah.
</p>
<p>
	The LRAD, then, is a military technology that has come home to U.S. soil as a command-and-control system for conveying both orders and force from police to civilians. Its erasure of the distinction between control and communication is not a unique phenomenon that emerges when you build a very loud speaker; rather, its inventor designed a speaker loud enough to “influence behavior and create safety zones” because he and his employers already conflated force and speech.

<!--more-->
<p>If you’ve come here after asking yourself (or Google) what cybernetics is, I recommend starting with Bernard Geoghegan and Benjamin Peters’ entry “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect041">Cybernetics</a>,” from the <cite>International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy</cite>, and Geoffrey Bowker’s “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/285691">How to Be Universal: Some Cybernetic Strategies, 1943–70</a>.” Ronald Kline’s <cite><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/cybernetics-moment-or-why-we-call-our-age-the-information-age/oclc/890127838">The Cybernetics Moment</a></cite> is the synthetic history the field has been waiting for. William Aspray’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1985.10018">The Scientific Conceptualization of Information: A Survey</a>” places cybernetics in the context of developments in computing and information theory, while Peter Galison’s “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343893">The Ontology of the Enemy: Norbert Wiener and the Cybernetic Vision</a>” is a classic account of the field’s military origins. The texts listed below survey the many forms cybernetics took in the decades that followed.</p>
	
<p>This bibliography is limited in three ways: It includes only books and articles which focus on cybernetics rather than the related histories of cyborgs and information theory; it includes only texts in English, though there are also substantial French and German literatures on the subject; and it excludes articles and dissertations that have been superseded by books by the same authors. Within these limitations, I welcome references to additional books and articles. I last updated this list on November 26, 2023.</p>

<p>This paragraph prompted me to reread David Brin’s 2006 essay “<a href="https://www.salon.com/2006/09/14/basic_2/">Why Johnny Can’t Code</a>,” another attempt to answer the  question of why kids don’t learn to program like they did in the 1980s. It’s a stirring essay, but it’s conclusion is merely that no one is providing “tools that teach creative thinking and technological mastery.” This begs another level of analysis—why aren’t these tools available to kids?—and Turkle provides part of it. I’m going to try to take her conclusion a step further.</p>
	
<p>We’ve come to see computers as tools for efficiency, not exploration. Sure, “surfing the web” has seen a resurgence in Wikipedia link-hopping, but I suspect even this is a minority activity. And even this is not an exploration of the computer. The meaning of the computer is less contested now than it was in decades past: computers are tools now, not worlds and certainly not the “mathland” Seymour Papert saw in them. It is as tools that teachers see computers, that managers see computers, that the developers at Microsoft and Apple see the interfaces they’re giving us. And they’re <i>developers</i>, not <i>programmers</i>, because they’re focused on the product of software, not the practice of programming.</p>
	
<p>Is there room in this world for programming as an intellectual pastime? Of course there is. That spirit is with us in free software and in other hacker communities. But hacking has become countercultural again, like it was in the 1970s. The idea that programming is worthwhile for the lessons it provides about logic, math, systems, and philosophy is as marginal now as it has ever been. The idea that it’s the best way for kids to learn these lessons is even more marginal.</p>
	
<p>All of this, Turkle hints, is not because computers themselves are marginal but precisely because they’re central to our lives. We have to learn so much just to use them—and we think that we have to teach so much to kids—that there’s no time for thinking, for experimenting with new forms, for looking at effects. If the geeky among us, adult and child alike, do find a spare hour, our “information consumption devices”—Brin’s phrase—rush to fill it. The personal computer has become less so, a device for listening like the radio before it.</p>

<p>Brin’s essay is structured around a quest for a tool his son can use to learn to program. He and his son eventually conclude that this tool is not, as they expected, some software that they can install on their Mac OS X or Windows machines; it is, instead, a used Commodore 64, released in 1982. It is a machine that does not connect to the internet and the web, a machine for which it has become a challenge to find software (not to mention that their floppy drive doesn’t really work). It’s a computer built with a set of purposes almost entirely different from those of a 2005 Dell box. Tinkerers, hobbyists, and gamers bought the Commodore 64; everyone buys Dells, which are supposed to have a practical function. The Commodore 64 boots to a BASIC prompt; any modern machine boots to a GUI. There is very little about computers built in the last twenty years that invites experimentation.</p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>

<p>I’m bothered by Brin’s preference for BASIC over other programming languages his son could learn. There are two options that strike me as superior. The first is Logo. It was actually designed for education, and depending on the implementation it can do lots of exciting things. (The technology education consulting company I used to work for endorses Terrapin Logo, which looks pretty cool.) The second is Ruby. There’s a <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Ruby interpreter</a> you can try without even leaving your browser, with a really amazing built-in tutorial. It’s at least a way to discover how a command line feels, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>There is another path Brin and his son could have followed. They could have installed Linux, or Cygwin, or resorted to the Terminal application on their Mac, and turned their machine into one that does invite experimentation. It would have taken some tinkering to get it to work how they wanted it to, of course, but that too is a learning experience—one about which Brin seems strangely unenthusiastic. They could have closed their browsers and the other ethereal apparatus of computing as consumption, even booted the machine to a command line and vanished the distractions of the GUI. Our polished, functional information consumption devices are flexible; they can still be subverted and used like the messy, hobbyist learning machines of the early 1980s.</p>]]></content><author><name>Peter Sachs Collopy</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="computing" /><category term="education" /><category term="technology" /><category term="media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the most brilliant thought I’ve ever read on technology education: The Second Self portrays a time of relative innocence [in the early 1980s].

<p>To begin with the basics, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is an online encyclopedia that anyone can write and edit. It’s an ambitious project, and one with both positive and negative aspects. Ideally, Wikipedia will help democratize education, providing the same information for free to everyone with an internet connection. In the worst case, this will be misinformation, and the site will miseducate.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Wikipedia articles can actually be changed by anyone. If you go to any article, you’ll find an “edit this page” link at the top, allowing you to do exactly that. Because anyone can add to or change Wikipedia entries, there’s no guarentee that information will be accurate. For the very same reason, though, anyone who finds a mistake, lie, or even grammatical error in an article can correct in themselves, making it easy to improve articles. I’m convinced that the vast majority of information on Wikipedia is accurate, and that it deserves some role in educational institutions. I also believe, however, that this role should be carefully considered and limited, and that educators should understand the process by which Wikipedia functions, not only the articles that result from it.</p>

<p>One reason I think that educators should learn about Wikipedia is that students already are. Bill Tancer, a researcher for Hitwise who studies consumer behavior online, notes that many of the popular search terms that bring users to Wikipedia from sites like Google “bear a close resemblance to elementary school homework and research projects.”</p>

<blockquote><p>During the month of February, which is also Black History month, three of the top 20 terms sending traffic to Wikipedia were for prominent black historical figures, while two other searches were likely motivated by Presidents Day. In fact, changing timeframes to any other month during the school year reveals a similar result.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">Bill Tancer, “<a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1595184,00.html">Look Who’s Using Wikipedia</a>,”<br>
<cite>Time</cite>, March 1, 2007.</div></blockquote>

<p>If students are already using Wikipedia as a resource, it’s important that teachers understand it. You might find more to like than you expect. I’ll tell you a bit about three attractive features of Wikipedia, though I’ll mention some negative aspects along the way too. These will be citations, comprehensiveness, and the site’s history and discussion tools.</p>

<p>The topic of Wikipedia and education has already received some press, though it’s mostly dealt with higher education. The most discussed event was a decision by the history department at Middlebury College to ban citing of Wikipedia in student papers. What’s interesting to me about this decision is that it actually reflects a consensus of educators and Wikipedians that the site is best used as a starting place for research rather than as a student’s only source. The following quotation is from Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales.</p>

<blockquote><p>The advice I would give to students is be careful how you use Wikipedia. It really isn’t a trusted source. It really is edited real-time and it could be full of mistakes.… I think it basically should be fine in schools… to add a footnote saying I did a lot of my preliminary research in Wikipedia, just to acknowledge where you got a lot of knowledge. But in terms of citing specific facts, you really should go to the sources and look it up there, because that’s what you’re supposed to be doing. The encyclopedia is supposed to give you the broad overview, not be a primary research tool…. I would say the same thing about Brittanica, by the way.</p>

<h2>Citations</h2>

<p>Fortunately, Wikipedia can be very helpful to those looking to find other sources on a subject. Articles generally have superscript links to endnotes interspersed throughout their text. There are many articles on the site without citations, but they are viewed by regular users as unpolished and in need of substantiation, while numerous citations are a hallmark of a good article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_%28polar_bear%29">Today’s featured article</a> on the site, about a polar bear named Knut, has 41 citations in a few pages of text. (Because Wikipedia is always changing, this might be different when you visit the article; you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knut_%28polar_bear%29&oldid=189143337">see it as I did</a>.) Because it’s about recent events, these citations all include links to stories in traditional news media, but articles also frequently cite books, academic journals, and other authoritative sources. The role of citations is so central on Wikipedia that they have come to be identified with the site.</p>

<h2>Comprehensiveness</h2>

<p>Another attractive feature of Wikipedia is its comprehensiveness. The English language site has over two million articles, many of them quite long and thorough. There have been a few studies comparing the coverage and accuract of Wikipedia to traditionally edited commercial encyclopedias.</p>

<p>The historian Roy Rosenzweig published an article on Wikipedia a year and a half ago in which he compared the site to both Encarta and American National Biography Online.</p>

<blockquote><p>To find 4 entries with errors in 25 biographies may seem a source for concern, but in fact it is exceptionally difficult to get every fact correct in reference works.… I checked 10 <cite>Encarta</cite> biographies for figures that also appear in <cite>Wikipedia</cite>, and in the commercial product I found at least 3 biographies with factual mistakes. Even the carefully edited <cite>American National Biography Online</cite>, whose biographies are written by experts, contains at least one factual error in the 25 entries I examined closely, the date of Nobel Prize winner I. I. Rabi’s doctoral degree—a date that <cite>Wikipedia</cite> gets right.…</p>
<p><cite>Wikipedia</cite>, then, beats <cite>Encarta</cite> but not <cite>American National Biography Online</cite> in coverage and roughly matches <cite>Encarta</cite> in accuracy.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">Roy Rosenzweig, “<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/42">Can History be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past</a>,”<br>
<cite>The Journal of American History</cite>, June 2006.</div></blockquote>

<p>American National Biography Online is a subscription service generally used by professional historians rather than students, so the performance of the free Wikipedia is pretty impressive. Also, Wikipedia generally improves in both accuracy and coverage as more people use and edit it, so Rosenzweig’s conclusions might be even more positive were he writing now.</p>

<p>The journal <cite>Nature</cite>, one of the two most prestigious in the sciences, published a similar comparison of Wikipedia and <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>’s web edition. They printed out copies of articles on the same topics from both websites without the source identified and sent them to experts. Their conclusions may be surprising:</p>

<blockquote><p>Among 42 entries tested, the difference in accuracy was not particularly great: the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.…</p>
<p><cite>Nature</cite>’s investigation suggests that Britannica’s advantage may not be great, at least when it comes to science entries. In the study, entries were chosen from the websites of Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica on a broad range of scientific disciplines and sent to a relevant expert for peer review. Each reviewer examined the entry on a single subject from the two encyclopaedias; they were not told which article came from which encyclopaedia.…</p>
<p>Only eight serious errors, such as misinterpretations of important concepts, were detected in the pairs of articles reviewed, four from each encyclopaedia. But reviewers also found many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 and 123 in Wikipedia and Britannica, respectively.</p>

<cite>Nature</cite>, December 15, 2005.</div></blockquote>

<p>Note that the <cite>Nature</cite> article is a couple of years old. I haven’t been able to find more recent such studies of the English language Wikipedia, though the magazine <cite>Stern</cite> did just publish an article on the German one under the heading “Wie gut ist Wikipedia?”</p>

<blockquote><p>Stern said the Wikipedia’s average rating was 1.7 on a scale where 1 is best and 6 is worst. The Brockhaus rated 2.7 on the same measure.</p>
<p>The articles were assessed for accuracy, completeness, how up to date they were and how easy they were to read.</p>
<p>In 43 matches [out of 50], the Wikipedia article was judged the winner.</p>

Deutsche Presse-Agentur, December 5, 2007.</div></blockquote>

<h2>History and Discussion</h2>

<p>The third attractive feature of Wikipedia is actually two features, the discussion and history pages. Every article has a set of links along the top. One of these links to the history of an article, which takes the form of a list of all the revisions that have been made. Because Wikipedia articles generally improve as more people edit them, simply looking at the number or frequency of these revisions can tell you something about the article. It's also possible, though, to click on the date of any one of these revisions and see how the article looked at that point in time. One can trace the development of an article all the way back to its original form, which is often only a sentence or two.</p>

<p>Another of these tabs at the top of an article to that article’s discussion page, also called the talk page. Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, researchers at the IBM Visual Communication Lab, describe it this way.</p>

<blockquote><p>The talk page is where the writers for an article hash out their differences, plan future edits, and come to agreement about tricky rhetorical points. This kind of debate doubtless happens in the <cite>New York Times</cite> and <cite>Britannica</cite> as well, but behind the scenes. Wikipedia readers can see it all, and understand how choices were made.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, “<a href="http://edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#viegas">The Hive Mind Ain’t What It Used To Be</a>,”<br>
Edge, 2006.</div></blockquote>

<p>The talk page is a great way to learn more about how an article is put together and decide how much to trust it. One can easily imagine a writer and editor at the <cite>New York Times</cite> arguing about whether an individual sentence or idea should appear in an article, but most of us never get to see this process in action. Wikipedia allows us to peel back the veil and see how our reference source is produced.</p>

<p>The article on Knut that I mentioned earlier is a “featured article,” selected because it’s particularly good. The range of article quality on Wikipedia is enormous, so now we’ll now look at an article that, while not exactly bad, isn’t up to the same standard. Garrett Morgan was an African American inventor who lived in Cleveland and is best known for his work on gas masks and traffic signals. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_A._Morgan">His article on Wikipedia</a>, unlike many websites run by museums and schools, does not claim that Morgan was the first to invent either the gas mask or the traffic signal. (The article has probably changed since I wrote this; you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garrett_A._Morgan&oldid=189286669">see it as I did</a>.) Most of the discussion page deals with these questions of priority, and specifically with whether to cite a website that provides apparently accurate descriptions of earlier inventions similar to Morgan’s, but appears to be motivated by racism. This is the sort of discussion from which one can learn a great deal, both about history and about how people use and learn from history.</p>

<p>The Garrett Morgan article also demonstrates something completely different: that the quality of writing on Wikipedia is often very poor. This is partly because of “writing by committee” and partly because many contributors are independently poor writers. Any user can take an article and improve its structure and grammer, but users are often more excited about writing new material. Below is an excerpt from the Morgan article:</p>

<blockquote><p>It has often been claimed that Morgan invented the first “gas mask”, however, the first gas mask was invented by Scottish chemist John Stenhouse in 1854. A precursor to the “gas mask” had been invented by Lewis Haslett in 1847 and granted US Patent no. 6529 in 1859. Numerous other inventors, including, Charles Anthony Deane (1823), John Tyndall (1871), Samuel Barton (1874), George Neally (1877), Henry Fleuss (1878), before Morgan’s invention that was patented in 1914 (US Patent numbers 1090936 and 1113675), but does not diminish Morgan’s heroism in using his mask to rescue the men trapped in the tunnel explosion, which was undertaken at considerable personal risk.</p>
<p>Some claim that Morgan did not invent the first “gas mask”, however, those references are usually in reference to the “respirator.” Morgan invented the safety hood and later revised it, which was used to save trapped workers in the Lake Erie Crib Disaster of 1917. His safety hood eventually evolved to become a type of gas mask.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">Wikipedia, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garrett_A._Morgan&oldid=189286669">Garrett A. Morgan</a>.”</div></blockquote>

<p>I’ll leave finding the grammatical errors as an exercise to the reader, but it’s worth noticing that both paragraphs begin similarly but seem to be written without a clear awareness of each other. The writing does not flow, a common problem on Wikipedia. It’s also worth noticing, though, that the excerpt is not particularly hard to understand. It communicates sufficiently without doing so elegantly or grammatically. Wikipedia is a bad place to learn about writing style, but poor writing detracts only a little from its purpose as an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Wikipedia should be looked at by educators as more than just a nuisance or a free encyclopedia. It's a potentially complicated tool, but one worth grappling with. I’ll close with the perspective of the researcher danah boyd, who studies relationships between youth and the internet:</p>

<blockquote><p>If educators would shift their thinking about Wikipedia, so much critical thinking could take place. The key value of Wikipedia is its transparency.

It’s an ambitious project, and one with both positive and negative aspects. Ideally, Wikipedia will help democratize education, providing the same information for free to everyone with an internet connection. In the worst case, this will be misinformation, and the site will miseducate. The vast majority of Wikipedia articles can actually be changed by anyone. If you go to any article, you’ll find an “edit this page” link at the top, allowing you to do exactly that. Because anyone can add to or change Wikipedia entries, there’s no guarentee that information will be accurate. For the very same reason, though, anyone who finds a mistake, lie, or even grammatical error in an article can correct in themselves, making it easy to improve articles. I’m convinced that the vast majority of information on Wikipedia is accurate, and that it deserves some role in educational institutions. I also believe, however, that this role should be carefully considered and limited, and that educators should understand the process by which Wikipedia functions, not only the articles that result from it. One reason I think that educators should learn about Wikipedia is that students already are. Bill Tancer, a researcher for Hitwise who studies consumer behavior online, notes that many of the popular search terms that bring users to Wikipedia from sites like Google “bear a close resemblance to elementary school homework and research projects.” During the month of February, which is also Black History month, three of the top 20 terms sending traffic to Wikipedia were for prominent black historical figures, while two other searches were likely motivated by Presidents Day. In fact, changing timeframes to any other month during the school year reveals a similar result. Bill Tancer, “Look Who’s Using Wikipedia,” Time, March 1, 2007. If students are already using Wikipedia as a resource, it’s important that teachers understand it. You might find more to like than you expect. I’ll tell you a bit about three attractive features of Wikipedia, though I’ll mention some negative aspects along the way too. These will be citations, comprehensiveness, and the site’s history and discussion tools. The topic of Wikipedia and education has already received some press, though it’s mostly dealt with higher education. The most discussed event was a decision by the history department at Middlebury College to ban citing of Wikipedia in student papers. What’s interesting to me about this decision is that it actually reflects a consensus of educators and Wikipedians that the site is best used as a starting place for research rather than as a student’s only source. The following quotation is from Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales. The advice I would give to students is be careful how you use Wikipedia. It really isn’t a trusted source. It really is edited real-time and it could be full of mistakes.… I think it basically should be fine in schools… to add a footnote saying I did a lot of my preliminary research in Wikipedia, just to acknowledge where you got a lot of knowledge. But in terms of citing specific facts, you really should go to the sources and look it up there, because that’s what you’re supposed to be doing. The encyclopedia is supposed to give you the broad overview, not be a primary research tool…. I would say the same thing about Brittanica, by the way. Jimmy Wales, net@nite 13, February 13, 2007. Citations Fortunately, Wikipedia can be very helpful to those looking to find other sources on a subject. Articles generally have superscript links to endnotes interspersed throughout their text. There are many articles on the site without citations, but they are viewed by regular users as unpolished and in need of substantiation, while numerous citations are a hallmark of a good article. Today’s featured article on the site, about a polar bear named Knut, has 41 citations in a few pages of text. (Because Wikipedia is always changing, this might be different when you visit the article; you can see it as I did.) Because it’s about recent events, these citations all include links to stories in traditional news media, but articles also frequently cite books, academic journals, and other authoritative sources. The role of citations is so central on Wikipedia that they have come to be identified with the site. Randall Munroe, “Wikipedian Protester,” xkcd, 2007. Comprehensiveness Another attractive feature of Wikipedia is its comprehensiveness. The English language site has over two million articles, many of them quite long and thorough. There have been a few studies comparing the coverage and accuract of Wikipedia to traditionally edited commercial encyclopedias. The historian Roy Rosenzweig published an article on Wikipedia a year and a half ago in which he compared the site to both Encarta and American National Biography Online. To find 4 entries with errors in 25 biographies may seem a source for concern, but in fact it is exceptionally difficult to get every fact correct in reference works.… I checked 10 Encarta biographies for figures that also appear in Wikipedia, and in the commercial product I found at least 3 biographies with factual mistakes. Even the carefully edited American National Biography Online, whose biographies are written by experts, contains at least one factual error in the 25 entries I examined closely, the date of Nobel Prize winner I. I. Rabi’s doctoral degree—a date that Wikipedia gets right.… Wikipedia, then, beats Encarta but not American National Biography Online in coverage and roughly matches Encarta in accuracy. Roy Rosenzweig, “Can History be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past,” The Journal of American History, June 2006. American National Biography Online is a subscription service generally used by professional historians rather than students, so the performance of the free Wikipedia is pretty impressive. Also, Wikipedia generally improves in both accuracy and coverage as more people use and edit it, so Rosenzweig’s conclusions might be even more positive were he writing now. The journal Nature, one of the two most prestigious in the sciences, published a similar comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica’s web edition. They printed out copies of articles on the same topics from both websites without the source identified and sent them to experts. Their conclusions may be surprising: Among 42 entries tested, the difference in accuracy was not particularly great: the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.… Nature’s investigation suggests that Britannica’s advantage may not be great, at least when it comes to science entries. In the study, entries were chosen from the websites of Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica on a broad range of scientific disciplines and sent to a relevant expert for peer review. Each reviewer examined the entry on a single subject from the two encyclopaedias; they were not told which article came from which encyclopaedia.… Only eight serious errors, such as misinterpretations of important concepts, were detected in the pairs of articles reviewed, four from each encyclopaedia. But reviewers also found many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 and 123 in Wikipedia and Britannica, respectively. Jim Giles, “Internet encyclopaedias go head to head,” Nature, December 15, 2005. Note that the Nature article is a couple of years old. I haven’t been able to find more recent such studies of the English language Wikipedia, though the magazine Stern did just publish an article on the German one under the heading “Wie gut ist Wikipedia?” Stern said the Wikipedia’s average rating was 1.7 on a scale where 1 is best and 6 is worst. The Brockhaus rated 2.7 on the same measure. The articles were assessed for accuracy, completeness, how up to date they were and how easy they were to read. In 43 matches [out of 50], the Wikipedia article was judged the winner. “Magazine hails German Wikipedia as better than encyclopaedia,” Deutsche Presse-Agentur, December 5, 2007. History and Discussion The third attractive feature of Wikipedia is actually two features, the discussion and history pages. Every article has a set of links along the top. One of these links to the history of an article, which takes the form of a list of all the revisions that have been made. Because Wikipedia articles generally improve as more people edit them, simply looking at the number or frequency of these revisions can tell you something about the article. It's also possible, though, to click on the date of any one of these revisions and see how the article looked at that point in time. One can trace the development of an article all the way back to its original form, which is often only a sentence or two. Another of these tabs at the top of an article to that article’s discussion page, also called the talk page. Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, researchers at the IBM Visual Communication Lab, describe it this way. The talk page is where the writers for an article hash out their differences, plan future edits, and come to agreement about tricky rhetorical points. This kind of debate doubtless happens in the New York Times and Britannica as well, but behind the scenes. Wikipedia readers can see it all, and understand how choices were made. Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, “The Hive Mind Ain’t What It Used To Be,” Edge, 2006. The talk page is a great way to learn more about how an article is put together and decide how much to trust it. One can easily imagine a writer and editor at the New York Times arguing about whether an individual sentence or idea should appear in an article, but most of us never get to see this process in action. Wikipedia allows us to peel back the veil and see how our reference source is produced. The article on Knut that I mentioned earlier is a “featured article,” selected because it’s particularly good. The range of article quality on Wikipedia is enormous, so now we’ll now look at an article that, while not exactly bad, isn’t up to the same standard. Garrett Morgan was an African American inventor who lived in Cleveland and is best known for his work on gas masks and traffic signals. His article on Wikipedia, unlike many websites run by museums and schools, does not claim that Morgan was the first to invent either the gas mask or the traffic signal. (The article has probably changed since I wrote this; you can see it as I did.) Most of the discussion page deals with these questions of priority, and specifically with whether to cite a website that provides apparently accurate descriptions of earlier inventions similar to Morgan’s, but appears to be motivated by racism. This is the sort of discussion from which one can learn a great deal, both about history and about how people use and learn from history. The Garrett Morgan article also demonstrates something completely different: that the quality of writing on Wikipedia is often very poor. This is partly because of “writing by committee” and partly because many contributors are independently poor writers. Any user can take an article and improve its structure and grammer, but users are often more excited about writing new material. Below is an excerpt from the Morgan article: It has often been claimed that Morgan invented the first “gas mask”, however, the first gas mask was invented by Scottish chemist John Stenhouse in 1854. A precursor to the “gas mask” had been invented by Lewis Haslett in 1847 and granted US Patent no. 6529 in 1859. Numerous other inventors, including, Charles Anthony Deane (1823), John Tyndall (1871), Samuel Barton (1874), George Neally (1877), Henry Fleuss (1878), before Morgan’s invention that was patented in 1914 (US Patent numbers 1090936 and 1113675), but does not diminish Morgan’s heroism in using his mask to rescue the men trapped in the tunnel explosion, which was undertaken at considerable personal risk. Some claim that Morgan did not invent the first “gas mask”, however, those references are usually in reference to the “respirator.” Morgan invented the safety hood and later revised it, which was used to save trapped workers in the Lake Erie Crib Disaster of 1917. His safety hood eventually evolved to become a type of gas mask. Wikipedia, “Garrett A. Morgan.” I’ll leave finding the grammatical errors as an exercise to the reader, but it’s worth noticing that both paragraphs begin similarly but seem to be written without a clear awareness of each other. The writing does not flow, a common problem on Wikipedia. It’s also worth noticing, though, that the excerpt is not particularly hard to understand. It communicates sufficiently without doing so elegantly or grammatically. Wikipedia is a bad place to learn about writing style, but poor writing detracts only a little from its purpose as an encyclopedia. Wikipedia should be looked at by educators as more than just a nuisance or a free encyclopedia. It's a potentially complicated tool, but one worth grappling with. I’ll close with the perspective of the researcher danah boyd, who studies relationships between youth and the internet: If educators would shift their thinking about Wikipedia, so much critical thinking could take place. The key value of Wikipedia is its transparency. You can understand how a page is constructed, who is invested, what their other investments are.

<p>Although 2007 brought a great deal of change with the opening of Facebook to outside developers, its original components have stayed remarkably fixed for three years. Among these initial features are some based on what I will term the <cite>High Fidelity</cite> model of identity, after a passage in Nick Hornby’s novel in which Rob, his narrator, explains that “what really matters is what you like, not what you are like.” Few of us would admit to basing our social lives on this principle, but it doesn’t seem to have hindered Facebook and other social network sites.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The locus of the <cite>High Fidelity</cite> model on Facebook is a box on each profile with the bland and unhelpful title “Information.” The Information box holds two categories of, well, information: Contact Info and Personal Info. Oddly, sexual orientation and relationship status, the most personal info on the profile, don’t go under the Personal Info heading; they’re important enough to be trumpeted at the top of the page. The information listed in Personal Info is much more broadly social and contextual: activities and interests, as well as favorite music, TV shows, movies, books, and quotes. The most expressive element, a freeform “about me” space, comes last, appearing <a href="http://motive.co.nz/glossary/fold.php">below the fold</a> on the profile.</p>
<p>So Facebook doesn’t draw much attention to the most flexible portion of the profile, but it does draw attention to the lists of favorite things, which tend to visually dominate the Information box. Each favorite thing is a convenient link to a list of other users who share a love of that particular cultural phenomenon. From the perspective of interface design, these links appear to be a key feature of Facebook, an obvious way of finding others. In practice, however, they’re little used, and their value, which is based on the <cite>High Fidelity</cite> principle, is limited.</p>
<p><a href="http://msu.edu/~lampecli/papers/chi2007_slashdot.pdf">According to social network researchers Cliff Lampe, Nicole Ellison, and Charles Steinfield</a>, users who list many favorite things have no more friends than those who list few. (Those who list none do have fewer friends, perhaps because they spend less time on Facebook generally.) This suggests that users don’t find each other on the site through shared cultural preferences. Indeed, the links may be present less for any particular purpose and more just because they can be; even birthdays are links on Facebook, though there’s little value in a list of others with the same birthday. (Birthday links also suggest, though, that features which seem useless if unobtrusive to some may be useful to others: believers in astrology and planners of joint birthday parties might disagree with my judgment against them.)</p>
<p>It turns out that social network sites, especially Facebook, are generally used to articulate existing friendships rather than to create new ones. (Lampe, Ellison, and Steinfield have also done <a href="http://msu.edu/~lampecli/papers/cscw2006.pdf">research on this point</a> with regard to Facebook.) Lists of favorite things, though, originated in a world where users were trying to create new relationships, on dating websites like Match.com. The value of these lists on dating websites was clear: as Hornby wrote of a hypothetical questionnaire for prospective dates, “it was intended a) to dispense with awkward conversation, and b) to prevent a chap from leaping into bed with someone who might, at a later date, turn out to have every Julio Iglesias record ever made.” I suspect the effects of using such lists on dating websites are not entirely positive—there’s a reason why the questionnaire idea is somewhere between absurd and offensive in print, and we shouldn’t ignore that reaction just because computers are involved.</p>
<p>Friendster, originally designed as a more sophisticated dating site, brought these lists into the new world of social network sites in 2002. The role of lists of favorite things on social network sites is a lot less clear, though. Facebook’s founder <a href="http://businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2007/06/ceos_must_be_de.html">Mark Zuckerberg has said</a> that “the other guys think the purpose of communication is to get information. We think the purpose of information is to get communication.” The information Facebook profiles provide can contribute to communication; in his webcomic xkcd, for instance, Randall Munroe depicts “<a href="http://xkcd.com/300/">looking up someone’s profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention</a>.” In general, though, lists of favorite things contribute little to communication.</p>
<p>Their greatest role might instead be in identity formation. To the extent that these lists matter, it is because they allow users to present themselves to an audience, and perhaps more importantly to themselves, in terms of their tastes. <a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/liu.html">Hugo Liu has studied this phenomenon in depth on MySpace</a>, <a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/liu.html#conclusions">concluding</a> that “the social network profile’s lists of interests might actually be more useful as an indicator of one’s aesthetics than as a factual declaration of interests.” Social network sites may not help us make friends, but they do provide us with new ways to express how we see ourselves.</p>

I have long described my own chaotic revision strategy as arising largely from the facts that I have written on computers for most of my literary life and that word processing seems to have a substantial impact on my writing process; the machine in front of me makes it easy to move sentences or paragraphs that seem to be in the wrong order, for instance, even if I’m not confident that the new order will be an improvement. “We often lose sight of writing as technology”[^1]; it is typically taught and discussed as a medium-neutral skill, when in fact the process of writing, and particularly the linearity of this process, varies depending on the technologies one employs.

In order to examine the ways in which this is the case I conducted interviews of Oberlin College students in which we discussed their writing processes, technologies, and techniques.[^2] I developed this revision of this essay from an earlier, more theoretical version. Here I maintain and expand some of the theory I described and developed in the previous revision, comparing my thoughts about writing processes and technologies with the experiences of others. I focus as much as possible on writing technologies, given the relative homogeneity of writing technology utilization at Oberlin, where the vast majority of students have and use computers. Technology is not, however, the only determining factor of writing process, so I describe other writing methods utilized by my interviewees as well, emphasizing the diversity of writing technique among Oberlin students.

## Pens and Structured Prewriting

Because pens and similar instruments have been the primary writing tools for millennia, the ways in which people write with a pen are still often viewed as the only ways people write. The chief characteristic of writing with a pen is linearity: words cannot be moved, so the obvious thing to do after writing a word is to write the next word. Rewriting requires either crossing out and writing in margins or between lines or writing another draft altogether. Traditional revision processes are thus highly structured, because while it takes a substantial amount of time to write out a new draft, there is little alternative once one’s paper becomes covered with corrections and changes.

This necessity of producing multiple distinct drafts, physically rewriting one’s paper each time, has a profound impact on how students are taught the process of writing. Students are often instructed to write in regimented and distinct stages such as outlining and the creation of rough and final drafts. Alternately, they are taught very little about revision processes and embrace the linearity of paper, revising only as an afterthought and thus only at the most detail-oriented levels of word choice and grammar.[^3]

The writing and prewriting processes of Oberlin students vary a great deal on these dimensions. Some view structures such as outlines as the foundations of their writing processes, for instance, while others shun them. Sally, a junior, handwrites a detailed outline laying out the paragraph structure of her essay, including her thesis at the head. Sandra, a first-year student, also handwrites a detailed outline if she has a clear idea of what she’s going to write, but develops a less precise mental outline if she does not. Jenny also keeps an outline in her head, and says that this process is precise enough that she can estimate the length of her paper based on the mental outline. These writers plan their essay structures before they write, and view writing primarily as a way to explain to others ideas that are already clear to them.

## Word Processors and Nonlinearity

Beginning to write without structure is just as common, however. Divya, for instance, begins “by writing a sentence here and there” in word processing software, then moves the sentences around and fills the gaps in between them. It was not until the invention of computerized word processing that writing became so nonlinear. It did so because word processing allows one to jump around within a document, adding a paragraph in one place and editing a sentence in another. Indeed, chaotic revision becomes as natural with a computer as it is unnatural with ink. One of the fundamental functions of a computer is to move data between locations within its memory. Just as fundamental is the tendency of ink to stay where it is, to be unmoving and relatively unchanging.

This suggests that the availability of word processors marked a revolution in writing revision; though in some ways it did, it did not entirely. There is reason to suspect that the impact of new technologies on the writing of experienced writers, for instance, is small. In 1980, when few writers used word processors, Nancy Sommers studied the revision processes of experienced writers, who often reported that they did not work in discrete drafts, but rather shaped their works organically, following processes not much different from those they would probably use today with computers.[^4] The impact upon student writers seems to be greater, however. In an early comparative study of revision in 1983, Richard Collier found that his subjects revised more and produced longer documents with text editing software, though the writing was not itself subjectively better.[^5]

Later studies generally found that students taught using word processors “improved the quality of their writing.”[^6] This improvement is due in part to the more positive attitudes many students had toward writing with a computer, but in a few studies most students reported negative views towards word processing. It is also thus likely due to the greater amount of revision done by the students using computers. Computers are not necessary for revision, but they make it a more obvious and central part of the writing process.

## Anti-Revision Technologies

This raises the question of whether computers sometimes provide distractions to writers more than they aid them. Oberlin writers to whom I spoke are sufficiently seduced by technology that none avoid word processing entirely, but many find that revision distracts them from writing their thoughts when they use a computer enough to use other technologies as well. Some of these writers are thus attracted to anti-revision technologies, including writing by hand and typewriting.

For instance, Sally writes her first drafts longhand from beginning to end, then types and revises them. We discussed her reasons for avoiding computers when writing her first draft. When she uses a computer, “I just lose track of everything,” she said. “I don't have any direction.” Sally find the nonlinearity of word processing frustrating, preferring to work only on one passage of her paper at a time. When typing, she spends time changing things she has already written, whereas when she handwrites she simply marks such flaws for later revision. It is only with the linearity of writing that she feels she can “keep a sense of… structure, direction, and flow.”

## ``Typewriters``

A second student to whom I spoke also found the distractions of computer revision bothersome enough to partially avoid them. Zoe, an Oberlin Conservatory of Music junior, wrote some of her short papers on a typewriter made in the 1930s. Zoe described how the typewriter slows down her writing process, forcing her to think more about the words she puts down on paper in two ways: the typewriter jams if she types quickly, and it makes fixing mistakes much more difficult. She told me that she thus often writes things the way she wants the first time. Writing on a typewriter also saves her the distractions provided by the internet and other capabilities of her computer, as well as those described by Sally of continually second-guessing that which one has just written. Zoe writes only short reading response papers on her typewriter, but writes more or less in one draft on computers as well, reflecting the same skills that allow her to use a typewriter effectively.

The similarities between Sally’s and Zoe’s writing processes demonstrate how the invention of the typewriter did little to change writing processes, as typewriters too utilize paper as a medium and are bound to its linear qualities. Typewriters also force their users to input one word after another even more strictly than do pen and paper, reinforcing the linearity of the writing process. It is harder to cross out or whiteout and edit typewritten text while writing than to do the same with a pen. Furthermore, it is not as feasible to insert additional text into a document with a typewriter as in the margins or between the lines of a handwritten text. Such amendments can be added to the typewritten document with a pen, but typewriters themselves compound the difficulty of revision.

The typewriter did introduce the keyboard, however, making it possible to generate multiple drafts in less time than with a pen. Writers who are capable of touch-typing can typically type much faster than they can write, and the ability to get words onto paper quickly accelerates the writing process. Because typewriters and personal computers share the technology of keyboards, there is some similarity of this sort between their uses.

## Metaphor I: Computers and Paper

Ted Nelson, most famous for coining the term *hypertext* in 1963 and beginning a project to implement it, argues that typewriters and computers are far more similar than they should be. One of his main arguments against the paradigms used to handle text on computers, including the word processor, is that they operate on metaphors drawn from our pre-computerized lives, metaphors that limit the range of things we can do with a computer. “Today’s arbitrarily constructed computer world,” writes Nelson, “is also based on paper simulation.… Paper is the flat heart of most of today’s software concepts.”[^7]

The word processor interface I am using to type this essay is intentionally designed to look like a paper page, in part because I am expected to print this out on paper. I have greater control over my writing process than I would on a typewriter, as I am able to move text around and edit at any point in the document. This too is often done through metaphor, though, as I cut, copy, and paste text. The metaphors relating to what is sometimes termed the clipboard—the virtual space in which text is stored after it has been cut or copied—are deliberately imprecise; in particular, I am not left with disturbing holes in my page after cutting. It is often such imprecise metaphors that lead to effective interface structures, and it is clear that a more literal cut function, for instance, would be less useful.

These imprecise metaphors often allow us to easily do things that would be much more challenging with the referenced media. Cecilia, for instance, uses numerous word processing windows to keep track of notes and ideas as she writes. According to the dominant metaphor, these represent “documents” placed in an overlapping manner on a “desktop.” She can in fact do more with her computerized documents than with real ones, however, such as moving text from one to another without rewriting it.

## Metaphor II: Text and Speech

Computing is not the only context in which metaphor is relevant to composition, however; the role of metaphor in writing actually applies at multiple levels. Were I typing on a typewriter or writing with a pen rather than using a word processor, for instance, I would still be using a metaphorical interface. Linearity makes writing with these tools similar to speech, but the relationship between speech and writing is stronger than mere similarity. Sommers writes that prescribed linear writing processes are “based on traditional rhetorical models… created to serve the spoken art of oratory.”[^8] The organization of ideas into a document, whether it be an essay, a story, or a poem, makes it fit the constraints of speech. The space of a page on which one writes replaces the time through which one might talk. The linear model of writing is imposed not only by the medium of paper, but also by the metaphor of speech. 

Historically, the transition from oratory to composition was a gradual one, and literate people read only out loud well into the medieval period. The deep basis of writing in the metaphor of speech sheds some light on the importance of speech in writing—the value, for instance, of reading one’s compositions aloud. It also restrains writing, however, restricting arrangement with the demand that a document be read linearly and given only one structure by its author.

Revision, whether implemented with a pen or more conveniently with a computer, is a “recursive shaping of thought by language” that breaks this metaphor with regard to process.[^9] As Roland Barthes cleverly explains, “paradoxically, it is ephemeral speech which is indelible, not monumental writing.”[^10] Nonetheless, as long as writers think in terms of the concept of a final and linear version of a document, written text draws heavily on its metaphorical relationship with speech.

These metaphors are forgotten with time, however, and consideration of the similarities and differences between a medium and the medium on which it is conceptually grounded becomes rare. Writers think only occasionally about the importance of the media in which they write because we have become so used to using them in static ways. A look at the variety of approaches people have to writing technologies helps to shake us from this state.

## Reliance

One concern about writing technology that is recurring and constant is that about reliance. The concern that we will lose our ability to do something once we have technology to do it for us is a concern that applies to all technologies, but it is particularly strong in technologies that relate to thought, since thought is widely viewed as the characteristic that makes us human. Dennis Baron describes how when he tried to write a memo on a pad of paper, “I found that I had become so used to composing virtual prose at the keyboard I could no longer draft anything coherent directly onto a piece of paper.”[^11]

This passage reminded me of the Isaac Asimov story “The Feeling of Power,” in which the people of the future have become so reliant on computers to perform mathematics that the techniques of arithmetic become lost knowledge.[^12] Skills that are lost due to dependence on technology are not truly obsoleted if situations remain which demand their use, and writing by hand is still, as Baron explains, a useful skill. While concerns of educators and intellectuals about the diminishing skill of students utilizing new technologies are often unfounded — I’ve heard about opposition to the pencil in the late 19th century because it allowed for revision — there are also legitimate reasons for concern. If we are unable to keep track of the interweaving of metaphor and new technique that forms a new writing technology, for instance, we cannot remain native users of both the new and the old technology; we cannot write with pen and computer with equal ease unless we have some understanding of the differences between them.

Baron continues, writing that “it wasn't so much that I couldn't think of the words, but the physical effort of handwriting, crossing out, revising, cutting and pasting… now seemed to overwhelm and constrict me, and I longed for the flexibility of digitized text.”[^13] This passage, and its context, which implies that Baron once wrote with these techniques, raises some questions to me: I can easily believe that Baron used to handwrite, cross out, and revise in order to produce written documents, but did he really cut and paste? Does the metaphor used in computing refer to a literal practice that was once widespread? Though I have not spoken with anyone who relies on scissors and glue in essay writing, Divya told me that a friend prints out drafts of her essays, cuts them into paragraphs, and experiments with paragraph order by laying out the individual paragraphs in various ways. As we gradually lose track of the metaphors that underlie our technologies, we lose track of how real and common the practices to which they refer were. I am genuinely uncertain whether the practice of physically cutting and pasting text to form a document was widespread and influenced the developers of computer interfaces; it seems an unlikely way of writing, but also perhaps a useful one.

Some of my interviewees engage in fiction writing and journaling, and tend to write creatively and journal in handwriting but write academically on a computer. They recognize the value of fluid revision for essays in which they focus upon an argument, but prefer linear writing when telling a story that takes place in linear time. Developing this kind of balance between the strengths of the different technologies available to us seems a sensible way to act in a world of multiple writing technologies.

I have long described my own chaotic revision strategy as arising largely from the facts that I have written on computers for most of my literary life and that word processing seems to have a substantial impact on my writing process; the machine in front of me makes it easy to move sentences or paragraphs that seem to be in the wrong order, for instance, even if I’m not confident that the new order will be an improvement. “We often lose sight of writing as technology”1; it is typically taught and discussed as a medium-neutral skill, when in fact the process of writing, and particularly the linearity of this process, varies depending on the technologies one employs. In order to examine the ways in which this is the case I conducted interviews of Oberlin College students in which we discussed their writing processes, technologies, and techniques.2 I developed this revision of this essay from an earlier, more theoretical version. Here I maintain and expand some of the theory I described and developed in the previous revision, comparing my thoughts about writing processes and technologies with the experiences of others. I focus as much as possible on writing technologies, given the relative homogeneity of writing technology utilization at Oberlin, where the vast majority of students have and use computers. Technology is not, however, the only determining factor of writing process, so I describe other writing methods utilized by my interviewees as well, emphasizing the diversity of writing technique among Oberlin students.
