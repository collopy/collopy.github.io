	I coedited the 2024 book <cite><a href="writing/2024/crossing-over/">Crossing Over: Art and Science at Caltech, 1920–2020</a></cite>, including my own essay on <a href="writing/2024/passing-in-the-hallway/">art and technology</a>, and directed an exhibition of the same title as part of Getty’s PST ART program. In 2020, I coproduced two series of presentations on Caltech’s history, one on <a href="presentations/2020/uncomfortable-things/">exclusion and injustice</a> and another on <a href="presentations/2020/becoming-caltech/">the 1910s and 1920s</a>.

	My research project “<a href="research/video/">The Revolution Will Be Videotaped</a>” explores how artists, psychotherapists, political organizers, and “video freaks” used video—and discourses of feedback and panpsychism which accompanied it—to experiment with mind and society in the 1960s and 1970s. I have published on <a href="writing/2014/video-synthesizers/">video synthesizers</a>, <a href="writing/2019/photographie-electronique/">electronic photography</a>, <a href="writing/2022/video-and-the-self/">self-observation</a>, <a href="writing/2023/video-is-as-powerful-as-lsd/">video and psychedelics</a>, and <a href="writing/2024/between-paradigms/">video art therapy</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In the history of biology and the human sciences, I have written about <a href="writing/2015/race-relationships/">racist and antiracist physical anthropology</a> and <a href="writing/2007/george-frederick-wright/">theistic evolutionism</a>. I serve as a managing editor and web administrator of the <cite><a href="https://histanthro.org">History of Anthropology Review</a></cite> and maintain a <a href="writing/2012/cybernetics-bibliography/">history of cybernetics bibliography</a>.
</p>
