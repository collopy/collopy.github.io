	I am a historian, archivist, and curator of American science, technology, and media.
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger; max-width: 500px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
	I study histories of <a href="research/video/">video</a>, <a href="research/computing/">computing</a>, <a href="research/evolution/">evolution</a>, <a href="research/human-sciences/">human sciences</a>, <a href="research/visual-culture/">visual culture</a>, <a href="research/consciousness/">technologies of consciousness</a>, and <a href="research/caltech/">Caltech</a>, where I work as University Archivist and Head of <a href="https://library.caltech.edu/archives/home">Archives and Special Collections</a>.

<p>
	I coedited the 2024 book <cite><a href="writing/2024/crossing-over/">Crossing Over: Art and Science at Caltech, 1920–2020</a></cite>, including my own essay on <a href="writing/2024/passing-in-the-hallway/">art and technology</a>, and directed an exhibition of the same title as part of Getty’s PST ART program. In 2020, I coproduced two series of presentations on Caltech’s history, one on <a href="presentations/2020/uncomfortable-things/">exclusion and injustice</a> and another on <a href="presentations/2020/becoming-caltech/">the 1910s and 1920s</a>.

	My research project “<a href="research/video/">The Revolution Will Be Videotaped</a>” explores how artists, psychotherapists, political organizers, and “video freaks” used video—and discourses of feedback and panpsychism which accompanied it—to experiment with mind and society in the 1960s and 1970s. I have published on <a href="writing/2024/between-paradigms/">video art therapy</a>, <a href="writing/2023/video-is-as-powerful-as-lsd/">video and psychedelics</a>, <a href="writing/2022/video-and-the-self/">self-observation</a>, <a href="writing/2019/photographie-electronique/">electronic photography</a>, and <a href="writing/2014/video-synthesizers/">video synthesizers</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In the history of biology and the human sciences, I have written about <a href="writing/2015/race-relationships">racist and antiracist physical anthropology</a> and <a href="writing/2007/george-frederick-wright/">theistic evolutionism</a>. I serve as a managing editor and web administrator of the <cite><a href="https://histanthro.org">History of Anthropology Review</a></cite> and maintain a <a href="writing/2012/cybernetics-bibliography/">history of cybernetics bibliography</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I teach descriptive bibliography, the study of books as material objects, as a lab instructor at <a href="https://rarebookschool.org">Rare Book School</a>. In 2022, I cotaught <a href="teaching/2022/curating/">Curating Art and Science</a> at Claremont Graduate University. From 2015 to 2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California, where I also taught <a href="teaching/2016/coldwar/">America in the Cold War World</a> and <a href="teaching/2017/evolution/">The Evolution Debates</a>. Before that, I studied and taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Oberlin College, was an organizer and board member of Mariposa Food Co-op and the Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, and worked as a web developer and science museum educator.
