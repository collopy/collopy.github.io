	I am a historian, archivist, and curator of American science, technology, and media.
</p>
<p>
	My research project “<a href="research/video">The Revolution Will Be Videotaped</a>” explores how artists, psychotherapists, political organizers, and “video freaks” used videotape recording—and discourses of feedback and panpsychism which accompanied it—to experiment with mind and society in the 1960s and 1970s. I have published on <a href="writing/2024/between-paradigms">video and art therapy</a>, <a href="writing/2023/video-is-as-powerful-as-lsd">psychedelics and technologies of consciousness</a>, <a href="writing/2022/video-and-the-self">theories of self-observation</a>, <a href="writing/2019/photographie-electronique">electronic photography</a>, and <a href="writing/2014/video-synthesizers">video synthesizers</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In the history of biology and the human sciences, I have written about <a href="writing/2015/race-relationships">white supremacy and its opponents in physical anthropology</a> and <a href="writing/2007/george-frederick-wright">theistic evolutionism</a>. I maintain a <a href="writing/2012/cybernetics-bibliography">bibliography of the history of cybernetics</a>.

<p>
	I am University Archivist and Head of <a href="https://library.caltech.edu/archives">Archives and Special Collections</a> at Caltech. In that role, I lead a team that facilitates understanding of Caltech’s role in the history of science and technology by curating research collections and public exhibitions. I also lead the team behind the expansive exhibition <cite><a href="exhibits/2024/crossing-over">Crossing Over: Art and Science at Caltech, 1920–2020</a></cite>, open at Caltech through December 15, and <a href="writing/2024/crossing-over">its catalog</a>, which features 12 essays on the visual culture of Caltech science.

<p>
	As a managing editor and web administrator of the <cite><a href="https://histanthro.org">History of Anthropology Review</a></cite>, I foster an intellectual community of historians and anthropologists.
</p>
<p>
	In 2022, I cotaught <a href="teaching/2022/curating">Curating Art and Science</a> at Claremont Graduate University. From 2015 to 2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California, where I also taught <a href="teaching/2016/coldwar">America in the Cold War World</a> and <a href="teaching/2017/evolution">The Evolution Debates</a>. Before that, I studied and taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Oberlin College, was an organizer and board member of Mariposa Food Co-op and the Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, and worked as a web developer and science museum educator.
