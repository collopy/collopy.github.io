A new exhibit put together by the Caltech Archives, <cite>Becoming Caltech: Building a Research Community</cite>, 1910–1930, showcases the decades before and after the Institute’s transition from Throop College to the California Institute of Technology.

<b>What is the scope of Becoming Caltech?</b>

In the exhibit, we focus on the transformation of the institution in two periods. The first started in the late aughts, around 1908, when there was a really deep rebuilding of the Institute from one that had tried to be many things to many people in Pasadena to one that was very specifically and narrowly an engineering school. The second period begins when that engineering school, which lasted in that form for about a decade, was successful enough that its leadership decided it could expand to be a scientific institute as well.
