The Caltech Archives is digitizing two major collections in the history of physics and astronomy, consisting of the papers of solar astronomer George Ellery Hale (1868–1938) and particle physicist Donald A. Glaser (1926–2013). We are also contributing to the history of physics through new acquisitions of Caltech scientists’ papers and a new exhibition on visual thinking in the work and life of Richard Feynman.
