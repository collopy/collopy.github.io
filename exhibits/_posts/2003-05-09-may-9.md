I curated this collection of emails sent and received by those trapped inside Case Western Reserve University’s Peter B. Lewis Building during a mass shooting on May 9th, 2003. While not comprehensive, it does display many of the attributes that these email exchanges shared: concern, friendship, and humor as well as fear.
